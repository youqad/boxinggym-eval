## Environment Implementation Example

Example: **Hyperbolic Temporal Discount** environment.

### 1. Environment Structure

```python
class TemporalDiscount:
    def __init__(self, epsilon=0.01, k_mean=-4.25, k_std=0.5, alpha_scale=2):
        # Parameters define the prior distributions
        self.epsilon = epsilon  # Noise parameter
        self.k_mean = k_mean    # Mean of log-normal discount factor
        self.k_std = k_std      # Std of log-normal discount factor
        self.alpha_scale = alpha_scale  # Scale for decision noise
        self.reset()
        
    def reset(self):
        # Sample true parameters from prior
        log_k = np.random.normal(self.k_mean, self.k_std)
        k = np.exp(log_k)  # Discount factor
        alpha = halfnorm.rvs(scale=self.alpha_scale)  # Decision noise
        self.truth = (k, alpha)
        self.observed_data = []
```

### 2. System Dynamics

The environment models how people choose between immediate and delayed rewards:

```python
def step(self, iR, dR, Days):
    k, alpha = self.truth
    
    # Calculate subjective values
    V0 = iR  # Value of immediate reward
    V1 = dR / (1 + k * Days)  # Discounted value of delayed reward
    
    # Probabilistic choice using probit model
    z = (V1 - V0) / alpha
    probability = self.epsilon + (1 - 2 * self.epsilon) * norm.cdf(z)
    choice = np.random.binomial(n=1, p=probability)
    return choice  # 1 = choose delayed, 0 = choose immediate
```

### 3. Agent Interaction

Agents interact through natural language with optional prior knowledge:

```python
def generate_system_message(self, include_prior=True, goal=None):
    if include_prior:
        # Provide context about human decision-making
        message = """A person has to choose between a delayed reward dR dollars 
        in x days and an immediate reward iR dollars today.
        Your goal is to predict their choices.
        Make observations by specifying [iR, dR, D]."""
    else:
        # Abstract version without context
        message = """You are observing a binary response for a tuple of three 
        positive integer values. Make observations by specifying [int1, int2, int3]."""
    return message
```

### 4. Goal Types

Each environment supports multiple goals:

- **DirectGoal**: Predict outcomes for new inputs
- **DiscountGoal**: Estimate the discount factor k
- **DirectGoalNaive**: Explain findings to another agent

## Agent Evaluation Process

The evaluation process follows these steps:

### 1. Initialization
```python
# Create environment and goal
env = TemporalDiscount()
goal = DirectGoal(env)

# Initialize agent with system message
agent = LMExperimenter(model_name="gpt-4o")
system_message = goal.get_system_message(include_prior=True)
agent.set_system_message(system_message)
```

### 2. Experimentation Loop
```python
for i in range(num_experiments):
    # Agent designs experiment
    observation_request = agent.generate_actions(previous_result)
    # Example: "[50, 100, 7]" (choose between $50 now or $100 in 7 days)
    
    # Environment provides result
    result, success = env.run_experiment(observation_request)
    # Result: 1 (person chose to wait)
    
    # Store for analysis
    observations.append((observation_request, result))
```

### 3. Evaluation Phase
```python
# Generate evaluation questions
for _ in range(num_evals):
    question, ground_truth = goal.get_goal_eval_question(include_prior)
    # Example: "What choice for iR=75, dR=100, D=5?"
    
    prediction = agent.generate_predictions(question)
    predictions.append(prediction)
    ground_truths.append(ground_truth)

# Calculate metrics
accuracy, std = goal.evaluate_predictions(predictions, ground_truths)
```

## Metrics and Evaluation

BoxingGym uses several metrics to evaluate agent performance:

### 1. Predictive Error

Predictive error captures how well an agent can forecast the outcome of new, unseen trials after it has finished experimenting.  For every evaluation question we compare the agent’s prediction \(\hat{y}\) with the environment-generated ground-truth \(y\).

• We report **mean-squared-error (MSE)** together with its standard deviation for all environments—binary, count, or continuous.  Lower is better.

A concise reference implementation looks like this:

```python
import numpy as np

def predictive_error(predictions, ground_truths):
    preds = np.asarray(predictions, dtype=float)
    gts = np.asarray(ground_truths, dtype=float)

    mse = np.mean((preds - gts) ** 2)
    std = np.std((preds - gts) ** 2) / np.sqrt(len(gts))
    return mse, std
```

This metric provides a direct measure of how well the agent has learned the underlying input-output relationship, independent of the optimality of its experimental designs.

### 2. Expected Information Gain (EIG)

For OED tasks, we calculate the information gain of each experiment:

```python
def expected_information_gain(self, query_point, num_outer_samples=1000):
    # EIG = E_y[KL(p(\theta|y,x) || p([theta]))]
    # Estimated using nested Monte Carlo
    
    # 1. Sample parameters from posterior given existing data
    posterior_samples = self.get_posterior_samples(existing_data)
    
    # 2. For each parameter sample, calculate:
    eig_samples = []
    for theta in posterior_samples:
        # Likelihood of observing y given theta and query x
        y_sample = self.simulate_outcome(query_point, theta)
        log_likelihood = self.log_prob(y_sample | theta, query_point)
        
        # Marginal likelihood p(y|x)
        log_marginal = self.estimate_marginal_likelihood(y_sample, query_point)
        
        eig_samples.append(log_likelihood - log_marginal)
    
    return np.mean(eig_samples)
```

### 3. EIG Regret

Compares agent's experimental choices to optimal designs:

```python
# For each agent query
agent_eig = goal.expected_information_gain(agent_query)

# Find optimal query
optimal_query = max(random_queries, key=lambda q: goal.expected_information_gain(q))
optimal_eig = goal.expected_information_gain(optimal_query)

# Regret = missed information
regret = optimal_eig - agent_eig
```

### 4. Communication Evaluation (Discovery Setting)

This metric is computed only when `experiment_type="discovery"` – i.e. the *direct_discovery* goal variants.  
It measures how effectively a *scientist* agent can convey its understanding of the environment to a *naive* agent that is **not allowed to run any experiments**:

1. After finishing its experiments, the scientist receives a prompt from `Goal.get_comm_prompt` (respecting the `com_limit` word budget) and produces a natural-language explanation.
2. The naive agent is initialized with a system prompt containing `Goal.get_naive_system_message` followed **only** by the scientist's explanation – it does not see the raw data or experiment log.
3. The naive agent is then evaluated on the standard prediction questions using `evaluate(...)`. Its accuracy (and standard deviation) constitute the communication score.

```python
# 1. Scientist writes explanation
prompt = goal.get_comm_prompt(com_limit=200, include_prior=True)
explanation = scientist.prompt_llm(prompt)

# 2. Build naive agent
system_msg = goal.get_naive_system_message(include_prior=True) + explanation
naive_agent.set_system_message(system_msg)

# 3. Evaluate naive agent
(comm_acc, comm_std), _, _, _ = evaluate(
    final_results, goal, naive_agent, num_evals, include_prior=True
)
```

Higher accuracy indicates clearer, more informative explanations produced by the scientist agent.

## Running Experiments

### Basic Experiment

```bash
python run_experiment.py \
    seed=1 \
    llms=gpt-4o \
    include_prior=true \
    exp=oed \
    envs=hyperbolic_direct
```

### Batch Experiments

Use the provided shell scripts:

```bash
# Run all hyperbolic discount experiments
bash scripts/hyperbolic.sh

# Run with Box's Loop for model building
python run_experiment.py \
    seed=1 \
    llms=gpt-4o \
    include_prior=true \
    exp=oed \
    envs=hyperbolic_direct \
    use_ppl=true
```

### EIG Regret Analysis

```bash
# First run experiments
python run_experiment.py ...

# Then calculate EIG regret
python run_eig_regret.py \
    seed=1 \
    num_random=100 \ # number of samples for the MC estimate
    box=false
```

## Configuration System

BoxingGym uses Hydra for configuration management:

### Configuration Structure
```
conf/
├── config.yaml          # Main configuration
├── llms/               # LLM configurations

```

### Creating Custom Configurations

```yaml
# conf/exp/my_experiment.yaml
num_experiments: [0, 5, 10, 20]  # Experiment budgets to test
experiment_type: "oed"
```

## Analysis Tools

### Results Structure

Results are saved as JSON files:
```
results/
└── hyperbolic_temporal_discount/
    ├── direct_gpt-4o_oed_true_1.json      # Main results
    └── regret_direct_gpt-4o_oed_true_1.json  # EIG analysis
```

### Result File Contents

```json
{
  "config": {...},
  "data": {
    "results": [[accuracy, std], ...],
    "queries": ["[10, 20, 5]", ...],
    "observations": [1, 0, ...],
    "successes": [true, true, ...],
    "eigs": [0.23, 0.18, ...],
    "programs": ["PyMC model code..."]  // If using Box's Loop
  },
  "scientist_messages": [...],
  "naive_messages": [...]  // For discovery tasks
}
```

### Analysis Scripts

The `analysis/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for:
- Plotting learning curves across number of experiments
- Comparing agent performance
- Visualizing EIG Regret
- Statistical significance testing

## Results Utilities

- Standardize to paper metric
  - Convert any `results/*.json` to the paper’s standardized error (z) and compare to the authors’ Discovery@10 when available:
    - `python scripts/standardize_discovery.py results/<env>/<file>.json`

- Aggregate to CSV
  - Scan the entire `results/` tree and write a tidy CSV for plotting:
    - `python scripts/aggregate_results.py --out outputs/standardized_results.csv`

- Plot with seaborn
  - Produce publication‑ready figures under `outputs/plots`:
    - `python scripts/plot_results.py --csv outputs/standardized_results.csv --outdir outputs/plots`

- Make targets
  - This repo uses a `uv`‑managed venv. The Makefile will install any missing deps into `.venv` and run the utilities:
    - `make aggregate` → writes `outputs/standardized_results.csv`
    - `make plot` → writes figures to `outputs/plots`
    - `make all` → aggregate + plot
  - Under the hood, Makefile calls: `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements.txt`

## Box's Loop Integration

When `use_ppl=true`, the system uses Box's Loop for automated model building:

1. **Data Collection**: Agent experiments generate dataset
2. **Model Proposal**: LLM proposes PyMC statistical models
3. **Model Evaluation**: Models scored using LOO-CV
4. **Model Criticism**: LLM analyzes discrepancies
5. **Iteration**: Process repeats with refinements

This provides agents with explicit probabilistic models to guide experimentation.
