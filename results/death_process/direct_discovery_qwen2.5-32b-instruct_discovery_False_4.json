            "Based on the observations, the output appears to increase as the input increases, but the relationship is not strictly linear. There seems to be a rapid increase in the output for very low input values, followed by a more gradual increase. For instance, the output jumps from 2 at 0.125 to 7 at 0.1875, indicating a steep rise in this range. As the input increases further, the output stabilizes and shows less variation. For example, the output is 11 for both 0.75 and 0.875, suggesting a plateau or flat region. The highest observed output of 20 occurs at 1.0, indicating a peak near the upper limit of the input range.\n\nTo predict the output for a given input, consider the following:\n- For inputs close to 0, expect a low output.\n- Between 0.125 and 0.25, the output increases rapidly.\n- From 0.25 to 0.875, the output increases gradually and may show some stability.\n- Near 1.0, the output reaches its peak.\n\nThis pattern should help you make informed predictions about the output for different float inputs within the range (0, 2)."
