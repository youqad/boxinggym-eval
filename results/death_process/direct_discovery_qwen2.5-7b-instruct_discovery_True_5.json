Given the current data, it appears that the number of infections could continue to rise until a more stable state is reached.\n\nTo predict the number of infected individuals at specific times without further experiments, consider the following:\n\n- From time 0.1 to 0.5, the number of infections increased significantly, indicating a rapid spread.\n- Between 0.5 and 0.65, the number of infections increased slightly, suggesting that the peak might not have been fully reached yet.\n- If the trend continues, the number of infections might stabilize or even start to decrease after a certain point.\n\nGiven these observations, a reasonable prediction for the number of infected individuals at time \\( t \\) can be made by extrapolating the trend. For instance, if you need to predict the number of infected individuals at time 0.7, you might assume a slight increase from the current trend, but with caution due to the observed fluctuations.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Prediction:} \\quad \\text{Number of infected individuals at } t = 0.7 \\approx 35 + \\Delta\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta\\) is a small positive increment based on the observed trend."
