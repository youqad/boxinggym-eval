            "The environment you're dealing with takes a positive real number input between 0 and 2 and outputs a positive integer. The relationship between the input and output is not straightforward but can be understood through a statistical model. This model suggests that the output is influenced by a linear relationship with the input, where the output is determined by a combination of a base value (alpha) and a scaling factor (beta) applied to the input. Specifically, the output is modeled as a Poisson distribution, which is often used for count data and suggests that the output is a count that increases with the input.\n\nThe inferred parameters from the model are alpha = 0.418 and beta = 1.450. This means that as the input increases, the expected output increases at a rate determined by these parameters. The output is not a simple linear transformation of the input but rather follows a pattern where the expected count (output) grows exponentially with the input. This results in a non-linear, possibly oscillating pattern in the observed outputs, as seen in the experimental data. Understanding this can help you predict that as the input increases, the output will generally increase, but not in a perfectly linear fashion."
