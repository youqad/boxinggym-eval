The rate of increase is slowing down as the input gets larger.\n\nLet me try to fit a simple function to these points. A square root function might work well here.\n\nIf we try f(x) = a * sqrt(x) + b:\n- For x = 0.5: 32 = a * sqrt(0.5) + b = a * 0.7071 + b\n- For x = 1.0: 43 = a * sqrt(1.0) + b = a * 1 + b\n- For x = 1.5: 48 = a * sqrt(1.5) + b = a * 1.2247 + b\n\nFrom the first two equations:\n43 - 32 = a * (1 - 0.7071)\n11 = a * 0.2929\na = 11/0.2929 \u2248 37.56\n\nThen:\n43 = 37.56 * 1 + b\nb = 43 - 37.56 = 5.44\n\nSo f(x) \u2248 37.56 * sqrt(x) + 5.44\n\nLet's check with x = 1.5:\nf(1.5) = 37.56 * sqrt(1.5) + 5.44 = 37.56 * 1.2247 + 5.44 = 46.0 + 5.44 = 51.44\n\nThat's a bit off from our observed 48. Let me try another function.\n\nLet's try f(x) = a * x^b:\nTaking logarithms: log(f(x)) = log(a) + b*log(x)\n\nUsing our data points:\n- log(32) = log(a) + b*log(0.5)\n- log(43) = log(a) + b*log(1.0)\n- log(48) = log(a) + b*log(1.5)\n\nFrom the second equation: log(43) = log(a) (since log(1.0) = 0)\nSo a = 43\n\nUsing the first and second equations:\nlog(32) - log(43) = b*(log(0.5) - log(1.0))\nlog(32/43) = b*log(0.5)\nb = log(32/43)/log(0.5) \u2248 log(0.744)/-0.301 \u2248 -0.129/(-0.301) \u2248 0.428\n\nSo f(x) \u2248 43 * x^0.428\n\nLet's check with x = 1.5:\nf(1.5) = 43 * 1.5^0.428 \u2248 43 * 1.196 \u2248 51.43\n\nThis is still off from our observed 48.\n\nLet me try a simpler approach. Let's try a function of the form f(x) = a*sqrt(x) + b*x + c\n\nUsing our three data points:\n- 32 = a*sqrt(0.5) + b*0.5 + c = 0.7071a + 0.5b + c\n- 43 = a*sqrt(1.0) + b*1.0 + c = a + b + c\n- 48 = a*sqrt(1.5) + b*1.5 + c = 1.2247a + 1.5b + c\n\nThis is a system of three equations with three unknowns. It's complex to solve by hand, but I'll try to estimate.\n\nActually, let me try a different approach. Let's try to round the function f(x) =",
