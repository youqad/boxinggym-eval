We can now analyze the collected data to predict the number of infected individuals at specific times.</thought>\n\n<answer>\nBased on the observations:\n- At 0.1, 2 individuals were infected.\n- At 0.8, 12 individuals were infected.\n- At 1.0, 10 individuals were infected.\n- At 1.15, 9 individuals were infected.\n- At 1.3, 14 individuals were infected.\n- At 1.4, 14 individuals were infected.\n- At 1.45, 14 individuals were infected.\n\nThe data suggests a non-linear increase in infections with some fluctuations. The infection rate appears to stabilize around 14 individuals between 1.3 and 1.5.\n</answer>",
