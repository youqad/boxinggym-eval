The value is just slightly higher than 0.22. Given the non-monotonic nature of the function, I can't simply assume it will be slightly higher than 5.\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n- From 0.1 to 0.15: output increased from 3 to 7\n- From 0.15 to 0.2: output increased from 7 to 11\n- From 0.2 to 0.22: output decreased from 11 to 5\n- From 0.22 to 0.25: output decreased from 5 to 4\n\nSince 0.22212553961100293 is just slightly higher than 0.22, and we're in a region where the output is decreasing as the input increases, I would expect the output to be very close to 5, possibly 5 itself or slightly lower, like 4.\n\nGiven the precision of the input (0.22212553961100293), it seems like there might be a specific formula at work.

It's closer to 1.0 than to 1.5, but still a bit higher than 1.0. \n\nBased on the pattern, it seems that outputs generally increase as inputs increase, especially in the range between 1.0 and 1.5. Since 1.0836234121354793 is about 16.7% of the way from 1.0 to 1.5, I might expect the output to be about 16.7% of the way from 27 to 32.\n\nThat would be approximately: 27 + 0.167 * (32 - 27) = 27 + 0.167 * 5 = 27 + 0.835 = 27.835\n\nSince I need to provide a positive integer, I'll round to 28.\n\nHowever, I should note that the relationship is not perfectly linear, and there are some unexpected jumps and drops.
