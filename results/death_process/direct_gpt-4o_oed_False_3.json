The output at 0.5 is 14, and assuming a linear relationship, the output at 0.18365039184766435 should be less than 14. I will calculate a rough estimate based on the proportion of the input within the 0 to 0.5 range.\n\nThe input 0.18365039184766435 is approximately 36.73% of the way from 0 to 0.5. If we assume a linear relationship, the output would be approximately 36.73% of the way from the output at 0 to the output at 0.5. Since the output at 0 is likely 0 (assuming the function starts at 0), the output at 0.18365039184766435 would be approximately 36.73% of 14, which is about 5.14.
