By time 1.0, 40 individuals are infected, suggesting the spread is slowing as it approaches the total population.

However, after this peak, the number of infected individuals decreases, with 47 at time 1.9 and 45 at time 1.95. This decrease suggests a recovery or immunity effect, where some individuals recover or become immune, reducing the number of active infections. The infection does not reach the entire population, stabilizing just below full saturation. This pattern suggests that while the disease spreads rapidly initially, it is eventually countered by recovery or immunity, leading to a decline in active infections. Predicting future infection numbers should consider this initial rapid spread followed by a peak and subsequent decline.</answer>"
