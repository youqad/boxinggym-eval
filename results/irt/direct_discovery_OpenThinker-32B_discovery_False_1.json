Then check if symmetry exists, like swapping the two numbers. Also, test extremes like (5,5), (0,5), etc. Let's start with (0,0). If it's 0, maybe the default is 0 unless certain conditions are met. If it's 1, perhaps there's a rule that triggers it here. Next, try (1,1) to see if same numbers have a pattern. Then (0,5) and (5,0) to check if order matters.

Next, try [1,1] to see if identical inputs yield a different result. Then proceed to test other combinations like [2,2], [3,3], etc., to check for consistency. Additionally, test [5,5] to see if the maximum values produce a specific outcome. Also, check [0,5] and [5,0] to see if extremes interact differently.

Additionally, check [0,0] if allowed, but since [0,0] might not be permitted, try [2,2] instead. This will help solidify whether equality always results in 0.

Let's test [1,0] again (which was 1) and [2,1] (0). If the difference between the first and second is positive, but [2,1] has a difference of 1, yet returns 0, that doesn't fit. Another idea: parity. [1,0] has first odd, second even \u2192 1. [2,1] has first even, second odd \u2192 0. Maybe the function returns 1 if the first number is odd and the second is even.

These numbers are all congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 3 (0 mod 3, 0 mod 3, 2 mod 3). Not sure. Alternatively, check if the second number is a multiple of 3 or 5. 0 is a multiple of both, 3 is a multiple of 3, 5 is a multiple of 5. But 5 isn't a multiple of 3. Alternatively, check if the second number is a divisor of 15 (0 excluded). 3 and 5 are divisors of 15. Maybe the function returns 1 when the second number is a divisor of 15 (excluding 1).

Another angle: the sum of the two numbers. For [1,0] sum is 1, [1,3] sum is 4, [1,5] sum is 6. These sums are 1, 4, 6. Not a clear pattern. Alternatively, the difference: 1-0=1, 1-3=-2, 1-5=-4. Not helpful. Maybe the product: 0, 3, 5. Still unclear. Let's try a different approach. Check if the function returns 1 when the first number is 1 and the second number is a prime or zero. Primes in 0-5 are 2, 3, 5. But [1,2] is invalid, [1,3] and [1,5] return 1. However, [1,0] also returns 1. So maybe primes or zero. Let's test [1,2] (invalid), but [1,3] and [1,5] work. Since 0 is included, maybe the function checks if the second number is a prime or zero. Let's test [1,0], [1,2] (invalid), [1,3], [1,5]. If this is the case, then [1,0], [1,3], [1,5] return 1, while others return 0. To confirm, check [1,7] (invalid). Since we can't, let's try [1,4] which is invalid. Alternatively, check [1,1] which returned 0 (1 is not prime). This seems plausible. Let's test another prime, like [1,2] (invalid). Since we can't, proceed to check [1,0], [1,3], [1,5]. If this pattern holds, then the function returns 1 when the first number is 1 and the second number is 0, 3, or 5. Let's test [1,0], [1,3], [1,5] again. All return 1. Now, check [1,2] (invalid), [1,4] (invalid). Let's try [1,6] (invalid). Since we can't, move to another test. Check [2,0]. Previously returned 0. If the first number is not 1, does it never return 1? Let's test [2,3]. If it returns 0, that supports the idea",
