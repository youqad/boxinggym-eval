            "The environment maps two integers, each ranging from 0 to 5, to a boolean output of 0 or 1. Based on the observations, the output seems to depend on the sum of the two integers. Specifically, the output is 1 when the sum of the inputs is 5 or greater. For example, inputs like [5, 0], [4, 1], and [3, 2] all result in an output of 1 because their sums are 5 or more. Conversely, when the sum is less than 5, the output is generally 0, as seen with inputs like [2, 1] and [2, 2].\n\nHowever, there are exceptions, such as [3, 1], which results in 1 despite the sum being 4. This suggests that while the sum is a strong indicator, there might be specific combinations that deviate from this pattern. Therefore, while predicting, consider the sum as a primary factor, but be aware of potential exceptions. If the sum is 5 or more, predict 1; if less, predict 0, but note that some combinations might not follow this rule."
