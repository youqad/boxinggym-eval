Since both integers range from 0 to 5, there are 6x6=36 possible combinations. Testing all might not be efficient, so I'll look for patterns. Maybe the output depends on the sum, difference, or product of the two numbers. Let me try some simple cases first. For example, when both inputs are 0. Then check if symmetry exists, like swapping the two numbers. Also, test extremes like (5,5), (0,5), etc. Let's start with (0,0). If it's 0, maybe the default is 0 unless certain conditions are met. If it's 1, perhaps there's a rule that triggers it here. Next, try (1,1) to see if same numbers have a pattern. Then (0,5) and (5,0) to check if order matters.
