For instance, student 0 has shown consistent correct answers, while other students have mixed results depending on the question. Question 1 seems to have a higher rate of correct answers compared to question 0. When making predictions, consider the individual student's past performance and the overall difficulty of the question based on previous observations. If a student has shown consistent correctness, predict they will likely answer correctly again.
