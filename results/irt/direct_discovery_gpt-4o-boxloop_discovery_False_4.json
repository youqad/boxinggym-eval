            "The environment maps two integers, each ranging from 0 to 5, to a boolean output (0 or 1). The output is determined by a logistic function, which is influenced by the sum of the weighted inputs and an intercept. Specifically, the second integer (x2) has a much larger positive influence on the output compared to the first integer (x1), as indicated by the inferred parameters: beta_x2 is significantly larger than beta_x1. This means that increasing the value of x2 is more likely to result in an output of 1. The intercept is negative, suggesting that when both inputs are low, the output is more likely to be 0.\n\nIn practical terms, if you want to predict the output, focus on the value of the second integer. Higher values of x2 increase the probability of the output being 1. The first integer, x1, has a smaller negative effect, so its influence is less significant. If both integers are low, expect the output to be 0. Conversely, if x2 is high, the output is more likely to be 1, regardless of x1. This understanding can help you make more accurate predictions about the environment's behavior."
