From the observations made, we can infer some patterns for specific students:\n\n1. **Student 0**: Answered question 0 incorrectly and question 1 correctly. This suggests variability in performance, but more data is needed for a reliable pattern.\n\n2. **Student 1**: Answered questions 1 and 3 correctly, but question 2 incorrectly. This indicates that student 1 may perform well on some questions but not others.\n\n3. **Student 2**: Answered questions 0 and 2 correctly, but questions 1 and 3 incorrectly. This suggests a pattern where student 2 might perform better on even-numbered questions.\n\nThese observations suggest that each student has a unique pattern of performance across different questions. To predict a student's answer correctly, one would need to understand these patterns. However, without further data, predictions remain uncertain. It is important to gather more observations to identify consistent patterns for each student across all questions."
