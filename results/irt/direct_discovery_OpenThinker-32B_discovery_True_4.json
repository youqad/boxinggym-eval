The remaining unobserved question for Student 0 is Question 1. However, since the user cannot query [0,1], we infer patterns from available data. Student 0's performance shows consistency in answering every third question correctly (Q0, Q3, Q4), suggesting a possible pattern or strength in certain question types. Assuming this pattern continues, Q5 (the next in sequence) is predicted to be correct. Additionally, since all other students except Student 3 answered Q0 correctly, and Student 0's overall accuracy is high (3/4 correct), predicting correctness for Q5 aligns with their demonstrated capability. Thus, the prediction for Student 0 on Q5 is **1**."
