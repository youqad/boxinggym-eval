            "The environment you're dealing with is a binary classification system that outputs either 0 or 1 based on two integer inputs, each ranging from 0 to 5. The underlying mechanism can be thought of as a logistic regression model, which uses a combination of the two inputs to determine the output probability. The model has three key parameters: two coefficients (beta_x1 and beta_x2) and an intercept. These parameters influence how each input contributes to the final decision.\n\nThe coefficients for the inputs are negative, meaning that as the values of the inputs increase, they tend to decrease the probability of the output being 1. The intercept is also negative, which further influences the baseline probability towards 0. This suggests that higher values of the inputs generally lead to a lower likelihood of the output being 1, unless specific conditions are met.\n\nFrom the observations, it seems that the output is 1 when both inputs are equal and possibly when they are at specific values. However, the exact pattern may not be straightforward due to the probabilistic nature of the model. To predict the output, consider both the values and equality of the inputs, keeping in mind that higher values generally decrease the probability of a 1."
