Observed examples include [5,1], [5,2], [5,3], and others. This suggests that 5 acts as a \"reset\" or \"override\" value, forcing the output to 0 regardless of the other number.\n\n3. **Non-Equal, Non-5 Pairs**: For pairs without 5 and where the integers are not equal, the output seems to depend on additional criteria. For instance, [0,1] and [1,0] return 0. Further testing would be needed to determine if this is due to parity, sum, or another factor. However, given the current data, a tentative rule could be that non-equal pairs without 5 return 0 unless another condition is met.\n\n**Prediction Strategy**:\n- If both numbers are equal and not 5: Output 1.\n- If either number is 5 (but not both): Output 0.\n- For other non-equal pairs, the output is likely 0, but further exploration might reveal exceptions. \n\nThis model explains the observed results and can be used to predict outputs for unseen pairs."

Since both integers range from 0 to 5, there are 6x6=36 possible combinations. Testing all might not be efficient, so I'll look for patterns. Maybe the output depends on the sum, difference, or product of the two numbers. Let me try some simple cases first. For example, when both inputs are 0. Then check if symmetry exists, like swapping the two numbers. Also, test extremes like (5,5), (0,5), etc. Let's start with (0,0). If it's 0, maybe the default is 0 unless certain conditions are met. If it's 1, perhaps there's a rule that triggers it here. Next, try (1,1) to see if same numbers have a pattern. Then (0,5) and (5,0) to check if order matters.

Alternatively, if it returns 0, then equality isn't the sole factor. Let's test this hypothesis. Additionally, checking [0, 1] and [1, 0] will help determine if the order of inputs affects the output. If [0, 1] and [1, 0] give different results, the function is not symmetric.
