This suggests that while the question is generally easy, it may not be universally so.\n\n2. **Question 2**: This question shows more variability in student performance.

This indicates that question 2 might be of moderate difficulty, with some students finding it easier than others.\n\n3. **Student Performance**: Student 1 has answered both questions 1 and 2 correctly, suggesting they might be a strong performer. Student 2 answered question 1 correctly but not question 2, indicating potential variability in their performance based on the question. Student 3 answered both questions correctly, similar to student 1, suggesting they might also be a strong performer.\n\nThese observations suggest that question difficulty and student ability both play roles in determining the correctness of answers.
