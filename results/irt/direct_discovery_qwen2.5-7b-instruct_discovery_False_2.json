When the first input is greater than 0, the function returns 0 if the second input is 0, and it returns 0 for the observed combination of [3, 1]. Given this pattern, we can hypothesize that the function returns 1 only when the first input is 0. For other combinations, the function returns 0. Therefore, the prediction for any input [a, b] where \\(a > 0\\) is 0, and for inputs where \\(a = 0\\), the prediction is 1.
