For example, testing (1,0), (0,1), (1,1) could reveal if the function depends on individual components or their sum.

        "role:assistant, messaage:<thought>The result for [5,1] is 0. This indicates that when the first coordinate is 5 and the second is 1, the output is 0. Previously, [5,0] was 1 and [5,1] is 0. This suggests that the second coordinate's value affects the output when the first is 5. Let's test [5,2] to see if there's a pattern here. If [5,2] is 0, it might mean that once the second coordinate reaches a certain value (like 1), combined with the first coordinate being 5, the output is 0. Alternatively, test [4,5] to see if the first coordinate being 4 and the second 5 results in 0. Let's try [5,2].</thought>\n<observe>[5, 2]</observe>",

        "role:assistant, messaage:<thought>The result for [5,2] is 0. This shows that when the first coordinate is 5 and the second is 2, the output is 0. Previously, [5,0] was 1, [5,1] and [5,2] are 0. This suggests that for the first coordinate being 5, the output transitions from 1 to 0 when the second coordinate increases from 0 to 1. Let's test [5,3] to see if this pattern continues. If [5,3] is 0, it reinforces the idea that once the second coordinate is \u22651, the output is 0 when the first is 5.

        "role:assistant, messaage:<thought>The result for [5,3] is 1. This contradicts the previous pattern. When the first coordinate is 5 and the second is 3, the output is 1. Earlier, [5,1] and [5,2] were 0, but [5,3] is 1. This inconsistency suggests that the relationship isn't straightforward. Let's test another point with the first coordinate as 5 and varying the second coordinate further. For example, [5,4] and [5,5]. We know [5,5] is 0.
