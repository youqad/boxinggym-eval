            "The environment's output is determined by a logistic regression model, which uses two integer inputs, x1 and x2, to predict a boolean output (0 or 1). The model uses coefficients (beta_x1 and beta_x2) and an intercept to calculate a probability, which is then converted to a binary outcome using a sigmoid function.\n\nThe inferred parameters suggest that x1 has a positive influence on the probability of the output being 1, as indicated by the positive beta_x1 value (1.702). Conversely, x2 has a negative influence, as shown by the negative beta_x2 value (-0.732). The intercept (-0.643) adjusts the baseline probability.\n\nIn practical terms, when x1 increases, the likelihood of the output being 1 increases, while an increase in x2 decreases this likelihood. The model's behavior can be observed in specific cases: when both integers are equal, the output tends to be 1, likely due to the balancing effect of the coefficients. However, when x1 is significantly larger than x2, the output is more likely to be 1, and when x2 is larger, the output is more likely to be 0. Understanding these relationships can help predict the environment's output for different input combinations."
