The key pattern is that the second integer has a much stronger influence than the first integer.\n\nWhen the second integer is small (0-4), the output is almost always 1, regardless of what the first integer is. However, when the second integer is 5 (the maximum value), the output is likely to be 0.\n\nThe first integer has a very minor negative effect, but it's much weaker than the effect of the second integer. This creates a decision boundary where inputs with the second integer equal to 5 typically output 0, while most other inputs output 1.\n\nTo predict the output:\n- If the second integer is 5, predict 0\n- For all other inputs, predict 1\n\nThis simple rule should give you high accuracy in predicting the environment's behavior.\n</answer>"

The high value of x1 = 5 also contributes a small negative effect, making it even more likely to be 0.\n\nMy rule was: \"If the second integer is 5, predict 0\".
