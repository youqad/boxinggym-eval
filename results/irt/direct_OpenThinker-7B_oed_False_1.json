So I need a systematic approach.\n\nFirst, maybe check some simple cases. For example, if both inputs are 0, what's the output? Or maybe check if one of the inputs has a direct effect. Let's try [0,0]. If that's 0, maybe check other combinations where one variable is fixed. Alternatively, check if the sum of the two numbers modulo something gives the output. But without any data points, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, pick a diagonal where the two numbers are equal. For example, [0,0], [1,1], ..., [5,5]. Maybe the output depends on whether they are equal. Let's test [0,0]. If that's 0, then maybe others. But I don't know yet. Let's start with [0,0].\n\n<observe>[0,0]</observe>",

But we need more data points.\n\nAlternatively, check [1,1]. If that's also 0, maybe the output is 0 when the two numbers are equal and 1 otherwise. Let's test that hypothesis. But first, let's confirm with another input. Let's try [0,1]. If the result is 1, then the hypothesis holds.

Wait, but [0,1] are different and output is 0. That contradicts my initial hypothesis. Hmm. So maybe the rule isn't simply based on equality. Let's think again.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 0 when the sum of the two numbers is even, and 1 when odd? Let's test that. For [0,0], sum is 0 (even) \u2192 0. [0,1] sum is 1 (odd) \u2192 1. But the result here was 0, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the product? [0,0] product 0 \u2192 0. [0,1] product 0 \u2192 0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum of the two numbers. For [0,0], max is 0. Suppose output is 0 when max is even? But [0,0] is even, output 0. [0,1] max is 1 (odd), but output was 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is 0 if at least one number is 0. Let's test [0,0] \u2192 0. [0,1] \u2192 0. What about [1,0] \u2192 0. Then [1,1] would be 0 as well. But what about [1,2]? If the rule is \"at least one is 0\", then [1,2] would be 0. But maybe the rule is different. Let's test [1,2]. If the output is 0, then the hypothesis holds. If not, maybe the rule is different.\n\nBut since I don't have data for [1,2], I need to choose another input. Let's try [1,0]. If that's 0, then the hypothesis holds.

Wait, no\u2014if the hypothesis is \"output 0 if either input is 0, else 1,\" then [2,2] would be 1.
