One possibility is that the output alternates (0, 1, 0, 1...) along rows or columns, or that there's some mathematical relationship between the coordinates and the output (like whether their sum is even or odd).\n\nIf the pattern is based on whether the sum of coordinates is even or odd:\n- [0, 0]: 0+0=0 (even) \u2192 0\n- [0, 1]: 0+1=1 (odd) \u2192 1\n- [0, 2]: 0+2=2 (even) \u2192 0\n\nThis matches my observations so far.

I haven't explored any points in row 1 yet, and I don't know if there's a pattern that relates to both coordinates.\n\nBased on the limited data, if there's a simple alternating pattern across both dimensions, then:\n- If row 0 starts with 0 and alternates (0,1,0,1,0,1)\n- Then row 1 might start with 1 and alternate (1,0,1,0,1,0)\n- Which would make row 2 start with 0 again, and so on\n\nUnder this hypothesis, [1, 3] would be 0 (since it would be the 4th element in row 1, which would be 0 if row 1 follows the pattern 1,0,1,0,1,0).\n\nBut this is just a guess based on very limited data.
