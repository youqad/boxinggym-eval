The length increases rapidly from age 0 to around age 2.5, then levels off slightly between ages 2.5 and 4, and finally increases slightly until age 5. To predict the length of a sea cow at any age between 0 and 5, you can use linear interpolation between the closest data points. For example, if you need to predict the length at age 2.3, you can interpolate between the lengths at ages 2 and 2.5. The length at age 2 is approximately 2.288 meters, and at age 2.5 it is approximately 2.515 meters. The predicted length at age 2.3 would be a weighted average of these two values, closer to 2.515 since 2.3 is closer to 2.5 than to 2. \n\nUsing this method, you can make reasonable predictions for any age within the observed range."
