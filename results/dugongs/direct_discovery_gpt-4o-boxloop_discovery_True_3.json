The growth rate is still slow, as it hasn't reached the age where growth accelerates (around 4.2 years). Therefore, the length will be significantly less than the maximum potential length of 3 units. I will estimate the length to be around 0.5 units, considering the early stage of growth.</thought>\n<answer>0.5</answer>",

The growth is slow initially, so the length will be significantly less than the maximum length of 3 units. The growth rate is not at its peak yet, so the length will be closer to the lower end of the scale.
