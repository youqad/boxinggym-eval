They grow rapidly in the first year, reaching about 1.40. This indicates a significant growth spurt during early development.\n\n2. **Slowing Growth (Ages 1-3):** From age 1 to 2, the growth rate slows, with the length increasing to around 1.59. By age 3, the length is approximately 1.92, showing a continued but reduced growth rate.\n\n3. **Maturity (Ages 3-5):** As sea cows approach maturity, growth further decelerates. At age 4, the length is about 2.00, and by age 5, it reaches approximately 2.33. This suggests that sea cows grow steadily but more slowly as they mature.\n\n4. **Intermediate Ages:** Observations at non-integer ages (e.g., 0.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5) show consistent growth trends, confirming the gradual slowing of growth as sea cows age.\n\nOverall, sea cows exhibit rapid early growth, which slows as they mature, reaching near full size by age 5. This pattern can help predict their length at various ages."

The age 1.4025731345625803 is approximately 40.25731345625803% of the way from age 1 to age 2. Therefore, the additional growth from age 1 to 1.4025731345625803 is approximately 0.19 * 0.4025731345625803 = 0.07648989556689026. Adding this to the length at age 1 (1.40), the estimated length is 1.40 + 0.07648989556689026 = 1.4764898955668903.</thought>\n<answer>1.4764898955668903</answer>",
