In this case, the parameters are \\( a = 0.124 \\), \\( b = -0.619 \\), and \\( c = 0.806 \\).\n\nThe positive value of \\( a \\) indicates that the parabola opens upwards, meaning the function has a trough or minimum point. The negative value of \\( b \\) suggests that the function decreases initially as you move from left to right, reaching a minimum, and then starts increasing again. The constant \\( c \\) represents the y-intercept, which is the function's value when the input \\( x \\) is zero.\n\nThe function's behavior is not linear; it decreases from the lower boundary, reaches a minimum around the midpoint, and then increases towards the upper boundary. The parameter \\( \\sigma = 0.243 \\) indicates some variability or noise in the observations, but the overall trend is captured by the quadratic model.
