Based on this pattern, we can make a rough prediction for the length of a sea cow at any given age within the range of 0 to 5.\n\nFor example, if you want to predict the length of a sea cow at age 2.8, you can interpolate between the lengths at ages 2.5 and 3. Given the data, the length at age 2.5 is 2.081782210564861 meters, and the length at age 3 is 1.8360924272523431 meters. A linear interpolation between these two points would give you an estimated length of approximately 1.958 meters.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simplified model based on the limited data points we have.
