The midpoint (2.5) yields a response of around 2.04, indicating a non-linear increase.\n\nIn the lower range, the response increases gradually from 0.87 at 0 to about 1.76 at 1.25.

As we move towards the middle range, the response at 1.875 is approximately 1.90, showing a continued increase but at a slower rate.\n\nIn the upper range, the response at 3.75 is about 2.45, close to the response at 5, suggesting a plateau or slower increase. However, at 4.375, the response drops to around 2.14, indicating a potential dip or fluctuation.\n\nOverall, the function seems to increase non-linearly with potential fluctuations or dips, particularly in the upper range.
