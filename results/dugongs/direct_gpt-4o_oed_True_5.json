The growth from age 0 to 1 is significant, and it continues to grow but at a slower rate from age 1 to 5. Given the observation at age 1 is approximately 0.987 and at age 2 is approximately 1.879, I can estimate the growth between these ages. The growth appears to be somewhat linear between these points. Therefore, for age 1.754, which is closer to age 2, I would expect the length to be slightly less than the length at age 2.</thought>\n<answer>1.7</answer>",
