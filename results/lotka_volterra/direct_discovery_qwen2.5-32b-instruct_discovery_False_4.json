The first element of the output varies significantly but seems to oscillate within a range.\n2. The second element generally increases but also shows some variability.\n\nTo predict the output for a new input:\n1. For the first element, consider the input's position relative to the observed points. If the input is closer to 0 or 50, expect values around 40-47. If closer to 12.5 or 43.75, expect values around 51.\n2. For the second element, note the general trend of increasing values but account for slight variations. Values tend to be around 8-14, with a slight increase as the input moves from 0 to 50.\n\nBy interpolating between these points, you can make a reasonable prediction for any input value."
