The function takes a float input between 0 and 50 and returns a tuple of two nonnegative floats. From the observations, we can infer some trends:\n\n1. The first output component seems to have a high value at lower inputs (e.g., 0, 6.25) and decreases as the input increases towards the midpoint (e.g., 25), then increases again towards the upper bound (e.g., 50).\n\n2. The second output component appears to be lower at the extremes (e.g., 0, 50) and higher around the midpoint (e.g., 25).\n\n3. There is a non-linear relationship between the input and the outputs, with fluctuations in both components as the input changes.\n\nTo predict the output for a new input, consider the input's position relative to the observed points. If the input is closer to a known point, the output is likely similar to that point. For inputs between known points, interpolate based on the trend observed in the surrounding data.
