            "Given the limited data and the requirement to make predictions without further experimentation, we can infer the following behavior of the function:\n\n1. **First Value**: The first value generally decreases as the input increases. It starts from a high value around 44 at 25 and decreases to 17 at 50. There seems to be a slight increase around the midpoint, but overall, it decreases.\n\n2. **Second Value**: The second value increases as the input decreases. It starts from 0 at 25 and increases to 5 at 5, then stabilizes around 1 to 3 as the input decreases further.\n\nBased on these observations, we can hypothesize that the function might have a piecewise linear or piecewise quadratic nature, with the first value decreasing and the second value increasing in a complementary manner.\n\nTo predict the output for any given input \\( x \\):\n\n- For \\( x \\) close to 25, the first value is likely to be high, and the second value is close to 0.\n- As \\( x \\) decreases, the first value decreases, and the second value increases.\n- For \\( x \\) close to 50, the first value is low, and the second value is close to 1.\n\nGiven this pattern, for an input \\( x \\):\n- If \\( x \\) is around 25, predict \\([40, 0]\\).\n- If \\( x \\) is around 10, predict \\([16, 2]\\).\n- If \\( x \\) is around 50, predict \\([17, 1]\\).\n\nThis provides a reasonable starting point for making predictions based on the observed trends."
