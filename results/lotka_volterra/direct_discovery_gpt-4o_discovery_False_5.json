It increases from 40 at input 0 to 48 at input 50, with various peaks and troughs in between. For instance, at input 18.75, the first value is 48, suggesting a peak, while at input 31.25, it drops to 40, indicating a trough.\n\nThe second value in the tuple appears more stable, generally hovering around 7 to 9. It remains constant over some intervals and changes slightly at others, such as increasing from 7 to 9 between inputs 12.5 and 25.\n\nGiven this behavior, the function might have a periodic or repeating pattern, with the first value oscillating and the second value showing minor variations. To predict the output for a new input, consider the observed patterns and anticipate similar oscillations and stability in the respective values.",
