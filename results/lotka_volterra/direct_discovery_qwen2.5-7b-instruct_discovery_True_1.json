The prey population seems to lead the predator population, suggesting a predator-prey relationship where the prey population increases first, followed by an increase in the predator population. Given this cyclic behavior, we can predict that the populations will continue to oscillate. To make a reliable prediction, we need to identify the key points in the cycle. Observations at 0, 6.25, 12.5, 20, 25, 35, and 50 have provided valuable insights into the cycle's structure.
