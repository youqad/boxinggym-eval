The first step is to gather data across the entire range of inputs to identify any trends, discontinuities, or patterns. Starting with evenly spaced points might provide a general overview. However, since there are two outputs, it's possible they have different behaviors. Maybe starting with the midpoint of the interval, which is 25, could give a central tendency. Alternatively, checking the boundaries (0 and 50) might reveal if the function has specific behaviors at the extremes.

Let's try input 50 to see the upper boundary.

These points can help determine if the second component's dip at 37.5 is part of a broader trend or an anomaly.
