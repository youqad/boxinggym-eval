            "In the predator-prey dynamic, populations often exhibit oscillatory behavior due to their interdependence. Initially, a high prey population supports a growing predator population. As predators increase, they consume more prey, causing the prey population to decline. With fewer prey, the predator population eventually decreases due to lack of food. This decline allows the prey population to recover, restarting the cycle.\n\nFrom the observations, we see this pattern: starting with a high prey population and a moderate predator population, the prey numbers drop as predators consume them. As predators peak, prey numbers are at their lowest. When prey numbers are low, predator numbers start to decline due to starvation, allowing prey to recover.\n\nAt time 0, prey were abundant, but by time 15, predators had reduced prey numbers significantly. By time 25, prey rebounded as predators dwindled. By time 35, predators increased again, reducing prey numbers. At time 40, both populations decreased, indicating a potential new cycle.\n\nTo predict future populations, consider this cycle: prey numbers rise when predators are low, and fall when predators are high. Predators follow prey trends but with a delay. This cyclical pattern is typical in predator-prey systems."
