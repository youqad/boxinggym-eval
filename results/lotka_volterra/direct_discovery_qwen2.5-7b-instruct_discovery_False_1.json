Given this pattern, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the function might continue to decrease the first value as the input increases, while the second value stays constant.\n\nTo make predictions, consider the following:\n1. For inputs in the range [0, 0.1], the output is likely to be [40, 9].\n2. For inputs slightly above 0.1, the output might start to decrease, but the second value will remain 9.\n3.
