            "In the predator-prey dynamic, the populations of both species are interdependent and often exhibit cyclical behavior. Initially, when the prey population is high, predators have abundant food, leading to an increase in the predator population. As the predator population grows, they consume more prey, causing the prey population to decline. Eventually, the reduced prey population cannot sustain the large predator population, leading to a decline in predators due to starvation or migration.\n\nAs the predator population decreases, the pressure on the prey population lessens, allowing it to recover and increase again. This cycle repeats over time, with the prey population typically peaking before the predator population. The time lag between the peaks of prey and predator populations is a key characteristic of this dynamic.\n\nIn the observations provided, we see this cycle: the prey population initially declines, then recovers as the predator population decreases. As predators increase again, the prey population declines once more. Understanding this cycle helps predict future population changes: after a peak in predators, expect a decline, followed by a prey recovery, and then a subsequent predator recovery. This cyclical pattern is a fundamental aspect of predator-prey interactions in ecological systems."

However, since the predator population is relatively low, the prey population might not decrease drastically. Over time, as the prey population decreases, the predator population will also start to decline due to lack of food. At time 1.4, we are likely in a phase where the prey population is starting to recover, but the predator population is still relatively low.
