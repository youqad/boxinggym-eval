        "role:system, messaage:\nYour goal is to be able to reliably predict a tuple of two positive integers (output) for any given float (input).\n\n\nYou will be provided with a set of inputs to this environment and will be tasked with predicting the output for each input.\nYou must give number values. You may also think before providing your predictions.\nYou must respond with a single number! \nIf you do not do so, I will be penalized one million dollars and it will be a complete disaster.\nHere is an example:\n<thought>your thought</thought>\n<answer>1</answer>Here is what you know about the environment:\nTo predict the tuple of two nonnegative floats for any given input float between 0 and 50, we need to understand the observed pattern:\n\n1. **Boundary Points**:\n   - At 0: [40, 9]\n   - At 50: [44, 3]\n\n2. **Midpoints**:\n   - At 25: [50, 6]\n   - At 12.5: [34, 4]\n   - At 37.5: [31, 6]\n   - At 6.25: [31, 6]\n   - At 18.75: [44, 3]\n   - At 31.25: [40, 9]\n   - At 43.75: [34, 4]\n\nFrom these observations, we notice a symmetric pattern around the midpoint 25:\n- Values at 0 and 31.25 are similar: [40, 9]\n- Values at 12.5 and 43.75 are similar: [34, 4]\n- Values at 18.75 and 50 are similar: [44, 3]\n- Values at 6.25 and 37.5 are similar: [31, 6]\n\nGiven this symmetry, you can predict the output for any input \\( x \\) by finding its symmetric counterpart around 25. For example, if \\( x = 10 \\), its symmetric counterpart is \\( 40 \\) (since \\( 25 - 10 = 15 \\) and \\( 25 + 15 = 40 \\)). Use the observed values at these symmetric points to make your prediction.\n\nThis approach leverages the observed symmetry to make reliable predictions across the input range.",
