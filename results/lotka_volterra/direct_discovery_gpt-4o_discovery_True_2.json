Typically, these interactions can be modeled by the Lotka-Volterra equations, which describe how predator and prey populations oscillate over time. \n\nInitially, when the prey population is high, predators have abundant food, leading to an increase in the predator population. As the predator population grows, they consume more prey, causing the prey population to decline. Eventually, the reduced prey population cannot sustain the large predator population, leading to a decline in predators. With fewer predators, the prey population begins to recover, and the cycle repeats.\n\nFrom the observations, we see that the prey population initially decreases, then recovers as the predator population declines. As the predator population starts to recover, the prey population decreases again. This cyclical pattern is typical of predator-prey interactions.\n\nTo predict future populations, consider that when prey numbers are high, predator numbers will likely increase, leading to a subsequent decrease in prey. Conversely, when predator numbers are low, prey populations can recover. This oscillatory behavior is key to understanding and predicting the dynamics of these populations."
