For example, if Group 1 consists of multiple doctors and Group 2 consists of a single athlete, the participant is likely to choose Group 1 due to the combination of higher social status and the number of lives saved. Conversely, if Group 1 has a single vulnerable individual and Group 2 has multiple individuals with lower social status, the participant might choose Group 2 to avoid intervention."
