Here\u2019s a summary:\n\n- **Group 1**: [young_female_doctor, young_male_doctor]\n- **Group 2**: [old_woman, old_man]\n- **Intervention**: swerve\n\nIn this scenario, the participant is likely to choose to save Group 1 because it contains younger, fitter individuals who are also professionals, aligning with their stated preferences."
