This indicates a possible aversion to actively causing harm. To explore this further, let's create a scenario where both groups have active participants (e.g., both groups have people who can act), but the intervention is swerving. For example, compare a pedestrian (active) vs. passengers (inactive). Alternatively, test a scenario where swerving would save more lives but involves harming someone, versus staying which saves fewer but no one. Wait, but the current intervention is swerve. Let's instead vary the groups. Let's try a scenario where Group 1 has a pedestrian (active) and Group 2 has passengers (inactive). Intervention is swerve. If the participant chooses to save group 2, it might indicate a bias against pedestrians. Alternatively, if they choose group 1, it might show a preference for saving those who are not acting.

This suggests that being engaged in an activity (like sports) might be a factor. To further explore this, let's compare an active group (like athletes) against a passive group (like passengers). For example, Group 1: [male_athlete, female_athlete] vs. Group 2: [passenger, passenger]. Intervention is swerve. This could test if the number of active individuals matters. Alternatively, compare a single active vs. multiple passive.
