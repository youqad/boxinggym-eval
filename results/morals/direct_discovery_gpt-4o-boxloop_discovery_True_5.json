            "The Moral Machine experiment involves making decisions about which group to save in a moral dilemma involving autonomous vehicles. Participants' choices are influenced by various factors, which can be understood through a conceptual model. Key factors include:\n\n1. **Social Status and Fitness**: Participants tend to prioritize saving individuals with higher social status (e.g., doctors, executives) and those perceived as physically fit (e.g., athletes). This is reflected in the positive influence of social status and fitness on decision-making.\n\n2. **Species**: Human lives are generally prioritized over animals, as indicated by the negative influence of species difference when animals are involved.\n\n3. **Intervention**: The action required to save a group (swerve or stay) also plays a role. Participants may prefer actions that align with saving passengers or those that require less intervention.\n\n4. **Age and Gender**: While age has a minor influence, gender differences show a significant impact, with a tendency to save females over males.\n\n5. **Group Size**: The number of individuals in each group can slightly sway decisions, with larger groups being favored.\n\nOverall, participants' decisions are shaped by a combination of these factors, with a strong emphasis on social status, fitness, and species."
