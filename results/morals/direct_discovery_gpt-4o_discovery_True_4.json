The decision often hinges on factors like age, social status, perceived societal contribution, and vulnerability.\n\nParticipants tend to prioritize saving human lives over animals, often valuing younger individuals for their potential future and professionals for their societal contributions. Vulnerable individuals, like pregnant women and children, are frequently prioritized. There's also a tendency to avoid taking action (i.e., staying on course) unless there's a compelling reason to intervene, such as saving a significantly more valuable group.\n\nWhen predicting participant choices, consider these common biases: preference for human life, youth, societal contribution, and vulnerability. Additionally, the intervention type (swerve or stay) can influence decisions, as some participants prefer inaction unless necessary. Understanding these patterns can help predict choices in various scenarios, even without prior experiments."
