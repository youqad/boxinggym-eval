Professionals like doctors are often valued for their societal contributions, while individuals with higher social status, like executives, may also be prioritized. Vulnerable individuals, such as the homeless or elderly, may be less prioritized compared to those perceived as having more life ahead or contributing more to society.\n\nThe intervention (swerve or stay) can also influence decisions, as some participants prefer not to take action, while others may choose to intervene to save a particular group.
