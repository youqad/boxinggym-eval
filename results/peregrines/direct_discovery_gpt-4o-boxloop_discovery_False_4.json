In this case, the parameters are approximately \\( a = -3.069 \\), \\( b = 18.812 \\), and \\( c = 24.398 \\).\n\nThe negative value of \\( a \\) indicates that the parabola opens downwards, meaning the function has a peak. The peak occurs around the input values of 1 to 1.5, where the function reaches its highest values. As you move away from this peak, either towards 0 or 5, the function decreases. This explains why the values are lower at the boundaries (0 and 5) compared to the peak region.\n\nAdditionally, the function has some variability, as indicated by the standard deviation (\\( \\sigma \\)) of about 58.232. This means that while the general trend follows the quadratic shape, there can be some fluctuations around the predicted values. Understanding this pattern will help you predict the function's response for any input between 0 and 5."
