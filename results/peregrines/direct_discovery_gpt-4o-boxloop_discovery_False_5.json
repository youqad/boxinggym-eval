            "The function you're trying to predict is a linear model with some variability. The model suggests that the response (y) is determined by a linear equation: y = alpha + beta * x, where alpha is approximately 25.644 and beta is approximately 26.040. This means that for every unit increase in the input (x), the response increases by about 26.040 units, starting from a base value of 25.644 when x is zero.\n\nHowever, the function also includes some randomness or noise, represented by sigma, which is about 85.800. This means that the actual observed response can vary around the predicted linear value, with a standard deviation of 85.800. This variability can cause the response to deviate significantly from the linear prediction, especially at certain points.\n\nIn practical terms, when predicting the response for a given input, you can use the linear equation to estimate the expected response. However, be aware that the actual response may differ due to the inherent variability in the system. This variability is why you observed different responses at similar input values during your experiments."
