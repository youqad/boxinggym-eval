        "role:assistant, messaage:<thought>The function has a peak at 1.5 with a response of 322. Since 1.4 is very close to 1.5, the response should be slightly less than 322. Observing the pattern, the response at 1.4 should be close to the peak value but slightly lower. I will estimate the response to be around 310.</thought>\n<answer>310</answer>"
