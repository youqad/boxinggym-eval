The function values around this region suggest a complex behavior, possibly involving a peak or a sharp change in slope. Given the limited information and the need to make a prediction without further experimentation, a reasonable assumption would be that the function has a peak near \\( x = 2.3 \\).\n\nTo make a prediction, consider the following:\n- The function value at \\( x = 2.3 \\) is 76.\n- The function value at \\( x = 2.4 \\) is 65, indicating a slight decrease after the peak.\n- The function value at \\( x = 2.2 \\) is 113, suggesting a significant increase before reaching the peak.\n\nGiven these observations, a safe prediction for the integer response of the function at a given input \\( x \\) would be to assume the highest observed value near the suspected peak. Therefore, for any input \\( x \\), the predicted response could be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Predicted Response} = \\begin{cases} \n76 & \\text{if } x \\approx 2.3 \\\\\n\\text{decreases as } x \\text{ moves away from 2.3}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThis prediction leverages the observed peak and the general trend of the function values around this region."
