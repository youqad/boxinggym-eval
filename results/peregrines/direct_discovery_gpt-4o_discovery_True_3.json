After the peak, the population begins to decrease, with counts of 293 at time 3 and 96 at time 3.5. By time 4, the population drops significantly to 25, and it reaches 0 by time 5.\n\nThis pattern suggests a rapid increase in population from time 0 to around time 2, followed by a gradual decrease after the peak. The population dynamics resemble a bell curve, with a sharp rise, a peak, and a subsequent decline.

Since time 3.4 is closer to time 3.5, the population count should be between 96 and 293, but closer to 96.
