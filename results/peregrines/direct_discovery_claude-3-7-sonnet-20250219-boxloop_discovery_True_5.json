The population starts around 80 at time 0, increases to reach a peak of about 217 at time 1.5, then decreases rapidly afterward.\n\nAfter the peak, the population follows a steep decline: 150 at time 2, 62 at time 2.5, 7 at time 3, 1 at time 3.5, and finally 0 at time 4 and beyond.\n\nTo predict the population at any time between 0 and 5:\n- For times between 0 and 1.5: The population increases, roughly following a quadratic curve.\n- For times between 1.5 and 4: The population decreases exponentially.\n- For times 4 and above: The population remains at 0.\n\nThe mathematical model suggests the decline phase follows an exponential decay pattern where the rate of decrease is proportional to the current population. This explains why the decline is initially steep but then slows as the population approaches zero.\n</answer>",
