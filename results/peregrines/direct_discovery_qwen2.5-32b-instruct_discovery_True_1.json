            "Based on the observations made, the population count of peregrine falcons shows a distinct pattern over time. Initially, at time 0, the population is 74. By time 1.25, the population significantly increases to 270, reaching a peak around time 2.0 with a count of 349. After the peak, the population rapidly declines; at time 2.5, it drops to 168, and by time 3.75 and 5, the population count is 0.\n\nTo predict the population count at a specific time, consider the following:\n- From 0 to 2.0, the population increases sharply, peaking around 2.0.\n- Between 2.0 and 2.5, the population starts to decline.\n- From 2.5 onwards, the population rapidly decreases to 0 by time 5.\n\nFor times close to 2.0, expect high population counts, decreasing as you move away from this peak. For times beyond 2.5, the population count will be very low, approaching zero. Use these trends to estimate the population count at any given time within the range of 0 to 5."
