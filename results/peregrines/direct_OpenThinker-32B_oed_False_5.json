The first step is to get a broad understanding by checking key points. Observing at the midpoint (2.5) might help identify if the function has any symmetry or critical points. Alternatively, starting at 0 and 5 could reveal boundary behaviors. However, since the function's nature is unknown, a balanced approach would be to start at the center and then expand symmetrically. Let me choose 2.5 as the first observation point to split the interval into two halves. This can help in determining whether the function increases, decreases, or has a plateau around the middle. If the response is different from adjacent points, it might indicate a peak or valley. If similar, maybe a linear trend.

Since the function's output is an integer, it's possible that the function has steps or changes abruptly. To check if there's a change before and after 2.5, I should observe points close to 2.5. Let's try 2.0 and 3.0 next. Starting with 2.0 to see if the value changes. If the value at 2.0 is the same as 2.5, maybe the function is constant in that region. If it's different, we can infer a slope or step. Alternatively, maybe the function has a high value around 2.5 and drops off.

To resolve this, we need more granular observations. Let's check the midpoint between 2.46875 and 2.4765625, which is approximately 2.47265625.
