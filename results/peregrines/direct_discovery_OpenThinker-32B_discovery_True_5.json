Since the time range is from 0 to 5, it's important to sample both ends and the middle to see if there's a linear or non-linear relationship. Starting with the midpoint might give a central value, but perhaps starting with the extremes first could help determine the range. Let me start by observing the population at time 0 and time 5 to see the initial and final counts. Then, proceed to check intermediate points like 2.5, 1, 3, etc., depending on the results. However, since the user wants me to make one observation now, maybe starting with the midpoint (2.5) would be a good idea to get a central value.

If the population at 2.5 is higher than 85, it suggests growth; if lower, decline. This information can guide further observations towards either end or other midpoints. Alternatively, checking time 5 next could show the endpoint, but without intermediate data, it's hard to infer the pattern.

If it's lower, there might be a peak around 2.5. Alternatively, checking a point between 2.5 and 5, like 4, could provide more insight into the trend after the midpoint.

Let's try time 4. If the population at 4 is still positive but lower than 128, it confirms the decline. Additionally, checking a point between 0 and 2.5, like 1, could help determine if the growth is linear or follows a different pattern.

If the population is still positive at 3, it narrows down the time frame of the crash. Alternatively, checking 3.5 might be even better. Let's try time 3 first. Additionally, confirming the growth phase between 0 and 2.5 by checking another point like 1 or 2 could help model the increasing part of the curve.

If the population at 3.5 is still positive, we can check closer to 4. Alternatively, if it's zero, the crash occurs between 3 and 3.5. Additionally, understanding the growth phase between 0 and 2.5 could help in modeling the entire curve. However, given the current focus on the decline phase, proceeding with time 3.5 is more urgent.

If not, continue narrowing down. Alternatively, check time 3.9 to get closer to 4. However, since the previous points showed rapid decline, checking 3.75 first makes sense.

If it's zero, between 3.5 and 3.625. However, since the user needs an integer prediction, maybe the exact crash time isn't critical, but understanding the trend is. However, to complete the model, let's check 3.625. Alternatively, since the population at 3.5 is 3 and at 3.75 is 0, the crash happens around 3.6-3.7.

We have data points at 0 (85), 2.5 (128). To understand the growth pattern, check another point between them, such as 1 or 2. Let's try time 1 first to see the early growth.

That implies the population peaked around time 1 and then started decreasing. However, this contradicts the previous assumption that the peak was at 2.5. This inconsistency needs clarification. Let's verify by checking another point between 1 and 2.5, such as time 2. If the population at time 2 is lower than 281, it confirms the peak around 1. If higher, there might be another peak.
