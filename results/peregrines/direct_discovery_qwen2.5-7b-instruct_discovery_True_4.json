            "To help you predict the population count of peregrine falcons at a specific time, let's analyze the trend we've observed. The population count decreases as time progresses, with a sharp drop between 2.0 and 2.5, followed by a more gradual decrease. Based on the observations, the population count seems to peak around 2.0 and then steadily decline. Given this pattern, we can infer that the population count is highest near 2.0 and decreases as time moves away from this point.\n\nTo make a prediction, consider the following:\n- If the time is close to 2.0, the population count will be high.\n- As the time moves away from 2.0, the population count will decrease.\n- The rate of decrease slows down as time progresses beyond 2.0.\n\nFor example, if you need to predict the population count at a specific time, say 2.3, you can estimate it to be lower than the count at 2.0 but higher than the count at 2.5. Given the data, a reasonable estimate would be around 150 to 180 peregrine falcons.\n\nPrediction for time 2.3: Approximately 150 to 180 peregrine falcons."
