There is a peak around 1.5, with a count of approximately 316, and the population decreases sharply after that. By 2.0, the count drops to 234, and by 2.5, it is 89. The population continues to decrease, reaching 42 at 2.75, and drops to 0 by 3.0. Given this pattern, we can predict that the population count will be highest around 1.5 and will decrease rapidly thereafter. \n\nTo predict the population count at a specific time \\( t \\):\n- If \\( t \\leq 1.5 \\), the population count will be high, peaking around 316.\n- If \\( 1.5 < t \\leq 2.75 \\), the population count will be moderate, ranging from 234 to 42.\n- If \\( t > 2.75 \\), the population count will be 0.\n\nFor example, if you need to predict the population count at \\( t = 1.0 \\), you can expect it to be higher than at 2.0 but less than the peak at 1.5.
