Time since surgery (time_surgery)\n2. Whether the cancer has metastasized (metastasized_status)\n\nThe inferred parameters tell us:\n- beta_metastasis = 6.322 (large positive value): Having metastasized cancer strongly increases the probability of death\n- beta_time = 0.895 (positive value): More time since surgery increases the probability of death, but less dramatically than metastasis\n- intercept = -12.876 (large negative value): The baseline probability of death is very low when both time since surgery is low and there's no metastasis\n\nThis explains the patterns I was observing. Let me craft an explanation based on this understanding.\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nBreast cancer survival prediction depends on two critical factors: time since surgery and whether the cancer has metastasized.\n\nMetastasis is the strongest predictor of mortality. When cancer has spread beyond the original site, the risk of death increases substantially. However, this risk isn't immediate - it develops over time.\n\nTime since surgery also plays an important role.
