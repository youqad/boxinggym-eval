            "Based on the observations, it appears that the binary response is influenced by a threshold in the continuous value. From the data, it seems that the response is positive when the continuous value is above approximately 4.77 and negative when it is below. Here\u2019s a simplified model:\n\n- If the continuous value is less than or equal to 4.77, the response is 0.\n- If the continuous value is greater than 4.77, the response is 1.\n\nGiven this threshold, you can predict the binary response by comparing the continuous value to 4.77. For example, if the continuous value is 5.09 (as seen in the third observation), the response would be 1 because 5.09 > 4.77. Conversely, if the continuous value is 1.72 (as seen in the twenty-second observation), the response would be 0 because 1.72 < 4.77.\n\nThis threshold model provides a straightforward way to predict the binary response without needing to run additional experiments."
