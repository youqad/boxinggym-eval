The intercept is very high (8.293), suggesting a high baseline probability of death\n2. Beta_metastasized is positive (4.149), meaning metastasization increases death probability\n3. Beta_time is strongly positive (7.713), meaning longer time since surgery significantly increases death probability\n4. The p values for the first 10 patients are all very high (close to 1), indicating high probability of death\n\nThis explains why all the patients I observed were dead - the model predicts extremely high death probabilities across the board. The time since surgery has an even stronger effect than metastasization status.\n\nI should explain that both factors increase mortality risk, with time since surgery being particularly important.\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nBased on the data, breast cancer patient survival is strongly influenced by two key factors: time since surgery and metastasization status. Both factors significantly increase mortality risk.\n\nTime since surgery has a particularly strong effect - the longer it's been since surgery, the higher the mortality risk. This suggests that survival chances decrease substantially as time passes after surgical intervention.\n\nMetastasization also increases mortality risk, though its effect is less pronounced than time since surgery. Patients whose cancer has metastasized face higher mortality rates compared to those without metastasis.\n\nThe baseline mortality risk is already quite high for these patients, and the combination of these factors creates a challenging prognosis profile. The relationship follows a logistic pattern, where the probability of mortality approaches 100% as these risk factors increase.\n\nTo predict survival, consider both factors but weigh time since surgery more heavily in your assessment. Patients with recent surgeries and no metastasis have the best relative chances, though overall mortality remains high in this population.\n</answer>"
