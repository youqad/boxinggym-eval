However, the first value is 0, which is closest to (0.23, 1) \u2192 0 and (0.25, 0) \u2192 1 in my observations.\n\nGiven the limited data and unclear pattern, I'll make a prediction based on the closest observations. Since the first value is 0 and I have observations with first values close to 0 giving both 0 and 1 as outputs, I'll go with the most common output for first values close to 0, which seems to be 0.\n</thought>\n<answer>0</answer>",
