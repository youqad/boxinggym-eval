For instance, patient ID 44 (time 4.84) survived, while patient ID 26 (time 8.09) did not. This suggests that while longer survival times generally correlate with better outcomes, other factors also play a role.\n\n2. **Metastasis Status**: Metastasized cancer (status 1) is associated with higher mortality risk. However, the presence of metastasis does not guarantee death. For example, patient ID 78 (metastasized, time 6.41) survived, while patient ID 35 (metastasized, time 0.37) did not. This indicates that the timing and extent of metastasis are crucial.\n\n3. **Combination of Factors**: The interaction between time since surgery and metastasis status is complex. Patients like ID 78 (longer time, metastasized) and ID 44 (shorter time, non-metastasized) show that both factors need to be considered together.\n\nGiven these observations, a patient with metastasized cancer and a shorter time since surgery (e.g., ID 35) is more likely to die, while a patient with no metastasized cancer and a longer time since surgery (e.g., ID 76) is more likely to survive.
