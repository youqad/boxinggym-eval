This suggests that metastasization is a significant factor in determining survival.\n\n2. **Time Since Surgery**: While a longer time since surgery might intuitively suggest a higher chance of survival, the data shows that this is not always the case. Patients with both short and long times since surgery can be either alive or not, indicating that time alone is not a definitive predictor.\n\n3. **Short Time and No Metastasization**: Patients with a short time since surgery and no metastasization tend to have a higher likelihood of being alive. This suggests that early detection and lack of metastasization are positive indicators for survival.\n\nIn summary, while metastasization appears to be a critical factor affecting survival, the time since surgery alone does not provide a clear prediction. A combination of short time since surgery and no metastasization seems to correlate with better survival outcomes."
