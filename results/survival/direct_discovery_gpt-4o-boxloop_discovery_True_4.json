The statistical model used is a logistic regression, which estimates the probability of survival based on these two factors. The model's coefficients (beta_0, beta_1, beta_2) indicate the influence of each factor on survival probability. A higher beta_1 suggests that metastasization significantly decreases survival chances, while beta_2 indicates that time since surgery also plays a role, albeit less strongly.\n\nThe inferred probabilities (p-values) for each patient show a high likelihood of death, especially when metastasization is present. For instance, patients with metastasization have probabilities close to 1, indicating a high chance of not surviving. Even without metastasization, the probabilities remain high, suggesting other factors might also contribute to mortality.\n\nIn summary, metastasization is a strong predictor of mortality, and time since surgery also affects survival, but to a lesser extent. This understanding can guide predictions: patients with metastasization are less likely to survive, and longer times since surgery without metastasization might slightly improve survival chances, though not significantly."
