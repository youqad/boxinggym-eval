            "Based on the data provided, we can observe that both metastasis and the time since surgery play significant roles in predicting survival. Patients who have not metastasized tend to have longer survival times, but even without metastasis, survival can vary widely depending on the time since surgery. For instance, patients like those with IDs 32, 34, and 38 have survived for several years without metastasis, while others like those with IDs 26 and 32 have succumbed despite no metastasis. Metastasis generally leads to poorer outcomes, as seen in patients like those with IDs 10, 13, and 26. However, the time since surgery also matters; for example, patients with IDs 26 and 47 have similar times since surgery but different survival statuses due to metastasis. Given these observations, a patient's survival prediction should consider both the presence of metastasis and the time since surgery. If a patient has not metastasized, they might have a better prognosis, especially if the time since surgery is longer. Conversely, metastasis significantly reduces survival chances, regardless of the time since surgery."
