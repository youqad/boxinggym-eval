From the data, it seems that the response transitions from negative to positive around a continuous value of approximately 3.0 to 4.0. Specifically, all values below 3.0 resulted in negative responses, while values above 4.0 resulted in positive responses. The exact threshold is likely somewhere between 3.0 and 4.0. \n\nGiven this information, you can make the following prediction:\n- If the continuous value is less than 3.0, the response is likely to be 0.\n- If the continuous value is greater than 4.0, the response is likely to be 1.\n- For values between 3.0 and 4.0, the response could be either 0 or 1, but based on the available data, it seems more likely to be 0.\n\nThis prediction is based on the observed trend in the data.
