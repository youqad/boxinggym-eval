            "Given the data and observations, we have seen that both metastasis and the time since surgery play significant roles in predicting survival. Metastasis generally correlates with shorter survival times, but there are exceptions where patients with metastasis can survive for extended periods. For instance, patient 50 survived 9.99 years despite metastasis, while patient 88 survived only 0.88 years. On the other hand, non-metastasis can also lead to both short and long survival times; patient 24 survived 0.74 years without metastasis, whereas patient 25 survived 8.39 years without metastasis. The key takeaway is that survival is influenced by multiple factors, and the interaction between metastasis and time since surgery is complex. Without metastasis, longer survival times are more common, but the presence of metastasis does not always result in shorter survival times. Therefore, to predict survival, consider both the time since surgery and the presence or absence of metastasis, understanding that these factors can vary widely among individuals."
