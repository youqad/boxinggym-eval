For instance, values like 0.30, 0.55, and 0.87 resulted in a response of 1, while values like 1.02 and 0.94 resulted in a response of 0. This suggests a threshold effect near 1, but with some variability. It's important to note that while lower values generally lead to a response of 1, this is not absolute, and some values close to 1 can result in a response of 0. Therefore, when predicting the binary response, consider that values significantly below 1 are more likely to yield a response of 1, while values above 1 are more likely to yield a response of 0, with some exceptions near the threshold.</answer>",
