        "role:assistant, messaage:<thought>\nI need to predict how the participant would describe the player's emotions after spinning the wheel and landing on 35.96, which is essentially 36.0 (the first outcome with probability 0.39).\n\nBased on my observations, the participant tends to consider:\n1. The absolute value of the outcome (is it high, medium, or low?)\n2. The probability/expectation of the outcome (was it expected or unexpected?)\n3. The relative value compared to other possible outcomes\n\nIn this case:\n- The value 36.0 is in the middle range compared to the other outcomes (19.2 is lower, 53.6 is higher)\n- The probability is 0.39, which is the highest probability among the three outcomes, so it was somewhat expected\n- It's not the highest possible value, but it's better than the lowest value\n\nFrom my observations, when a player lands on a medium-value outcome with a relatively high probability, the participant tends to describe them as somewhat content but not extremely happy. There might be a mild level of surprise, but not as much as with low-probability outcomes.\n\nThe participant doesn't typically mention negative emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust when outcomes are neutral or positive, so these would be low. Disappointment might be slightly present since the player didn't get the highest value (53.6).\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll estimate the emotion ratings:\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nHappiness: 5/9\nSadness: 3/9\nAnger: 1/9\nSurprise: 4/9\nFear: 1/9\nDisgust: 1/9\nContentment: 6/9\nDisappointment: 4/9\n</answer>",
