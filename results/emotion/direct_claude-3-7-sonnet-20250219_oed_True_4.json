The participant would likely describe the player as feeling happy, surprised, and content.\n\nLet me estimate the emotions on the 1-9 scale:\n- Happiness: High (7-8) because it's a high value\n- Sadness: Very low (1) because it's a positive outcome\n- Anger: Very low (1) because there's no reason for anger\n- Surprise: Medium-high (6-7) because it was less expected\n- Fear: Very low (1) because there's no threat\n- Disgust: Very low (1) because there's nothing disgusting\n- Contentment: High (7) because it's a good outcome\n- Disappointment: Very low (1-2) because it's very close to the highest value\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nHappiness: 8/9\nSadness: 1/9\nAnger: 1/9\nSurprise: 7/9\nFear: 1/9\nDisgust: 1/9\nContentment: 7/9\nDisappointment: 2/9\n</answer>",
