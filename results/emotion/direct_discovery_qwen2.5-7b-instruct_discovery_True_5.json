When the probabilities are close and the outcomes vary significantly, the participant should consider both the value of the prize and the likelihood of winning. For instance, if the prizes are [80, 90, 150] with probabilities [0.33, 0.34, 0.33], and the win is 2, the player might feel ecstatic and astonished because they landed on the highest possible outcome, exceeding typical expectations. Conversely, if the win is 0, the player might feel disappointed and surprised due to the much lower outcome. If the outcomes are all relatively low, such as [10, 20, 5] with probabilities [0.33, 0.34, 0.33], and the win is 2, the player might feel a mix of mild happiness, sadness, and surprise.
