            "To predict how the participant thinks the player feels after each spin of the wheel, consider both the prize value and the probability of winning that prize. The participant's predictions are influenced by the value of the prize, the probability of winning it, and the element of surprise.\n\n1. **High-Value Prizes**: Winning a high-value prize generally leads to positive emotions like happiness and contentment, especially if the probability of winning it is low, adding an element of surprise.\n\n2. **Low-Value Prizes**: Winning a low-value prize often results in negative emotions such as sadness or disappointment, particularly if the probability of winning it is high, as it aligns with low expectations.\n\n3. **Middle-Value Prizes**: Winning a middle-value prize tends to evoke mixed emotions, balancing moderate happiness with a sense of average expectation, especially when probabilities are equal.\n\n4. **Probability Influence**: The less likely an outcome, the more surprise it generates, affecting the emotional response. A high-value prize with low probability is more exciting, while a low-value prize with high probability is more disappointing.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can better predict the participant's perception of the player's emotions after each spin."

This would lead to a high level of surprise. However, 34.1 is also the lowest value among the possible outcomes, which could lead to disappointment. The combination of low probability and low value suggests that the player might feel surprised due to the unexpected nature of the outcome, but also disappointed because it is the least favorable result.
