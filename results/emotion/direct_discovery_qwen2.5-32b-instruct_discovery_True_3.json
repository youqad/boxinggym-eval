            "To predict how the player feels after each spin of the wheel, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Size of the Prize**: Larger prizes generally lead to more positive emotions like happiness, excitement, and ecstasy. Smaller prizes may result in contentment or disappointment depending on the context.\n\n2. **Probability of Winning**: Higher probabilities of winning a prize often lead to more predictable emotions such as contentment or satisfaction. Lower probabilities can result in stronger emotions like surprise, joy, or disappointment.\n\n3. **Outcome vs. Expectation**: If the outcome aligns with the player\u2019s expectations, they are likely to feel content or satisfied. If the outcome exceeds expectations, especially with a high-value prize, the player may feel ecstatic and surprised. Conversely, if the outcome falls short of expectations, especially with a low-value prize, the player may feel disappointed or frustrated.\n\nBy combining these factors, you can predict the player's emotional state. For example:\n- A high-probability win of a small prize might lead to contentment.\n- A low-probability win of a large prize might lead to ecstasy and surprise.\n- A low-probability win of a small prize might lead to disappointment.\n\nUnderstanding these dynamics will help you make accurate predictions about the player's feelings after each spin."
