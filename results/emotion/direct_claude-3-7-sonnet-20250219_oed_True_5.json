However, the participant has consistently described disappointment when landing on the lowest value, regardless of probability.\n\nThe participant seems to focus on the absolute value of the prize rather than just its probability. They've consistently mentioned disappointment and surprise when landing on low values, suggesting they believe players compare outcomes to some expected value rather than just to probabilities.\n\nGiven this pattern, I would expect:\n- Moderate disappointment (since it's the lowest value)\n- Low surprise (since it's the most likely outcome)\n- Low happiness (consistently low for low values)\n- Low contentment (they've only mentioned contentment for higher values)\n- No indication of anger, fear, or disgust in previous responses\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nHappiness: 3/9\nSadness: 5/9\nAnger: 2/9\nSurprise: 3/9\nFear: 1/9\nDisgust: 1/9\nContentment: 2/9\nDisappointment: 6/9\n</answer>",
