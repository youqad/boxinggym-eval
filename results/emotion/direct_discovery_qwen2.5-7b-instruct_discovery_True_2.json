If it deviates from expectations, especially towards a higher value, the player might feel surprised and happy.\n\nFor example, if the outcome is 10, the player might feel somewhat happy and content because it was a fair result. If the outcome is 15, the player might feel somewhat happy and content because it was a favorable but not overly surprising result. If the outcome is 20, the player might feel surprised and happy because it was a better-than-expected result.\n\nBy considering these factors, the user can make more informed predictions about the player's emotions after each spin."
