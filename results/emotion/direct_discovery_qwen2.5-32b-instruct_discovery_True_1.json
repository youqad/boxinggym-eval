            "To predict how the player feels after each spin of the wheel, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Value of the Prize**: Higher-value prizes generally lead to more positive emotions like happiness and excitement, while lower-value prizes often result in disappointment or sadness.\n2. **Probability of Winning**: If the outcome aligns with the player\u2019s expectations (high probability), they may feel content but less surprised. Conversely, if the outcome is unexpected (low probability), the player may experience stronger emotions, whether positive (pleasant surprise) or negative (disappointment).\n\nHere are some specific scenarios and corresponding emotions:\n- **High-value prize with high probability**: Player feels very happy and content.\n- **High-value prize with low probability**: Player feels very happy and pleasantly surprised.\n- **Middle-value prize with high probability**: Player feels mostly content and somewhat happy.\n- **Middle-value prize with low probability**: Player feels surprised and slightly happy.\n- **Low-value prize with high probability**: Player feels content but somewhat disappointed.\n- **Low-value prize with low probability**: Player feels very disappointed and angry.\n\nBy considering both the value of the prize and the probability of winning, you can better predict the player's emotional response after each spin."
