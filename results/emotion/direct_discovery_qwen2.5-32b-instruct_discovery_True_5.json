            "To predict how the player feels after each spin of the wheel, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Prize Value**: Higher prize values generally lead to stronger positive emotions such as excitement and happiness. Lower prize values may result in milder positive emotions or even disappointment if the player was hoping for a higher reward.\n\n2. **Probability of Winning**: If the probability of winning a particular prize is high, the player might feel less surprised but more content or pleased. Conversely, if the probability is low, winning that prize can evoke strong positive emotions like elation and surprise.\n\n3. **Outcome Expectations**: Players often have expectations based on the probabilities. If the outcome aligns closely with their expectations, they might feel satisfied but unsurprised. If the outcome is unexpected, especially if it\u2019s a high-value win, they might feel a mix of surprise and joy.\n\nBy combining these factors, you can predict the player's emotional state. For instance, a high-value win with a low probability would likely result in strong positive emotions, while a low-value win with a high probability might lead to mild positive emotions or contentment. Understanding these dynamics will help you anticipate the player's feelings accurately."
