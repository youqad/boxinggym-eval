            "To predict how the player feels after each spin of the wheel, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Prize Value**: Higher prizes generally lead to stronger positive emotions like happiness, ecstasy, and contentment. Lower prizes may result in disappointment or mild contentment, depending on the probability.\n\n2. **Probability**: High-probability outcomes often lead to contentment and satisfaction, especially if the prize is moderate to high. Low-probability outcomes can evoke strong emotions\u2014ecstasy for high prizes and disappointment for low prizes.\n\n3. **Expectation vs. Reality**: If the outcome meets or exceeds expectations, the player is likely to feel happy, content, or ecstatic. If the outcome falls short of expectations, the player may feel disappointed or sad.\n\n4. **Surprise Factor**: Unexpected outcomes, whether positive or negative, tend to evoke surprise along with other emotions. For instance, winning a high prize with low probability can lead to pleasant surprise and ecstasy.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can predict the player's emotional state based on the prize value and probability of the outcome. For example, a high prize with a moderate probability might lead to ecstasy and pleasant surprise, while a low prize with a high probability might result in mild contentment or disappointment."
