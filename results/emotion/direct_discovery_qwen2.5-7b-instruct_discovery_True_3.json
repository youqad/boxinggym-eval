            "The player's feelings after each spin of the wheel can be influenced by both the probability of winning and the value of the prize. If the probability of winning a higher prize is low, the player might feel disappointed even if the prize is valuable. Conversely, if the probability is high but the prize is low, the player might feel content. When the probability is moderate and the prize is moderate, the player's feelings can range from content to pleasantly surprised depending on whether the outcome matches or exceeds their expectations.\n\nGiven these factors, here is a detailed explanation for the participant to make predictions:\n\n1. **Low Probability, High Value**: If the probability of winning a high-value prize is low, the player might feel disappointed even if they win, due to the low likelihood of the outcome.\n2. **Moderate Probability, Moderate Value**: If the probability is moderate and the prize is also moderate, the player's feelings can vary. They might feel content if the outcome matches their expectations or pleasantly surprised if it exceeds them.\n3. **High Probability, Low Value**: If the probability of winning a low-value prize is high, the player might feel content, as the outcome is within their expectations.\n4. **High Probability, High Value**: If the probability of winning a high-value prize is high, the player might feel pleasantly surprised and content, as the outcome exceeds their expectations.\n\nBy considering these factors, the participant can better predict the player's emotions after each spin."
