            "<thought>\nGiven the constraints, I need to provide a detailed explanation of how the player's emotions might vary based on different outcomes and probabilities without running additional experiments. I will describe the general patterns observed from previous interactions and how the player's emotions are typically influenced by the size of the prize and the probability of winning.\n</thought>\n\nTo predict how the player feels after each spin, consider the size of the prize and the probability of winning it. When the player wins a smaller prize with a higher probability, they might feel mildly satisfied or content. For instance, winning a prize of 10 with a high probability (e.g., 0.7) often results in a sense of relief or mild satisfaction.\n\nIf the player wins a larger prize with a lower probability, they might feel pleasantly surprised or excited. For example, winning a prize of 100 with a low probability (e.g., 0.1) often leads to a strong positive emotion like excitement or joy.\n\nConversely, if the player wins a smaller prize with a lower probability, they might feel disappointed or slightly frustrated. Winning a prize of 10 with a low probability (e.g., 0.1) could result in disappointment since the outcome was not as favorable as hoped.\n\nUnderstanding these patterns can help you predict the player's emotional state based on the outcome of each spin."
