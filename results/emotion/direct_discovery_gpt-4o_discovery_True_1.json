The participant seems to weigh both the expectedness of the outcome and the value of the prize in their emotional predictions.\n\n1. **High Prize, High Probability**: If the player wins a high prize with a high probability, they might feel happy and content, as the outcome is both rewarding and expected.\n\n2. **Low Prize, Low Probability**: Winning a low prize with a low probability might lead to surprise and disappointment, as the outcome is unexpected and not rewarding.\n\n3. **High Prize, Low Probability**: This scenario might make the player feel ecstatic and pleasantly surprised, as they receive a high reward unexpectedly.\n\n4. **Mid-Range Prize, Moderate Probability**: Winning a mid-range prize with moderate probability might result in moderate happiness, as the outcome is somewhat expected and moderately rewarding.\n\n5. **Low Prize, High Probability**: The player might feel disappointed, as the outcome is expected but not rewarding.\n\nIn summary, the participant's predictions are influenced by how expected the outcome is and how rewarding the prize is.
