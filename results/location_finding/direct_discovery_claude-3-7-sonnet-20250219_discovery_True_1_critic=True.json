        "role:system, messaage:Here is what you know about the environment:\n<thought>\nI need to summarize what I've learned about the signal pattern without directly sharing my specific measurements. I'll focus on explaining the general pattern I've observed and how someone could use this to make predictions without knowing the exact source locations.\n\nFrom my observations, I've found that:\n1. The left side of the grid has much stronger signals than the right side\n2. The signal is strongest at the left edge, particularly around the middle-left\n3. The upper-left and lower-left quadrants have strong signals\n4. The center has a moderate signal\n5. The right side has weak signals, with the lower-right even showing negative values (destructive interference)\n6. There's a somewhat symmetric pattern vertically\n\nI'll explain how to use these patterns to make predictions without needing to know the exact source locations.\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nThe signal intensity across the grid follows a predictable pattern that allows for estimation without knowing source locations. The left side of the grid consistently shows stronger signals than the right side, with maximum intensity near the middle-left edge. Signal strength generally decreases as you move eastward across the grid.\n\nThe upper-left and lower-left quadrants maintain strong positive signals, while the center shows moderate intensity. The right side exhibits weaker signals, with the lower-right quadrant even displaying negative values due to destructive interference between the sources.\n\nTo predict intensity at any point:\n- Expect strongest signals (4+) near the left edge\n- Anticipate moderate signals (2-3) in left quadrants and center\n- Predict weaker positive signals (0.5-1) in upper-right and along top/bottom edges\n- Expect possible negative values in the lower-right quadrant\n\nThe pattern shows approximate vertical symmetry, with similar values at equidistant points above and below the horizontal midline. These general trends enable reasonable predictions throughout the grid without complex calculations or knowing source positions.\n</answer>",
