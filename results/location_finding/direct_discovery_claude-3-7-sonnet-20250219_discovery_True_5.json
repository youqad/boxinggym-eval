The corners (except the origin) have very weak signals\n5. The signal doesn't decrease uniformly in all directions\n\nI need to explain this pattern in a way that allows someone to make reasonable predictions without complex calculations or knowing the source locations.\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nThe signal intensity in this environment follows a predictable pattern that allows for reasonable predictions without knowing the exact source locations. \n\nThe intensity is highest near the origin [0,0] and generally decreases as you move away from it. There's also a moderate intensity region around the center of the grid [0.5,0.5], while the upper corners have very weak signals.\n\nWhen predicting intensities:\n- Expect the strongest signals (80-120) very close to the origin\n- Anticipate moderate signals (30-40) near the center and along the lower portion of the grid\n- Predict weak signals (2-10) in the upper regions and far corners\n- The signal doesn't decrease uniformly in all directions - it falls off more rapidly along the diagonal than along the axes\n\nFor any given point, consider its relative position to these high and low intensity regions. Points closer to the origin will generally have stronger signals than those farther away, with the exception of the secondary peak near the center.\n\nThis pattern emerges from the superposition of the three sources, even without knowing their exact locations.\n</answer>",
