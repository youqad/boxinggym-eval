Identifying these trends can help predict values for unobserved points.\n\n2. **Local Peaks and Valleys**: Some regions may have local peaks or valleys, where scalar values are significantly higher or lower than surrounding areas. Observing points around these regions can help map out the extent and shape of these features.\n\n3. **Gradient Exploration**: By observing points that are close to each other, you can determine the rate of change or gradient in scalar values.
