For example, at (1.0, 0.0) the value is 2.98, and at (-1.0, 0.0) it is 1.24.\n3. **Y-Axis Observations**: Moving along the y-axis, the value also decreases. At (0.0, 1.0) the value is 3.63, and at (0.0, -1.0) it is 0.8.\n4. **Diagonal Observations**: Moving diagonally, the value decreases but at different rates. For instance, at (1.0, 1.0) the value is 4.21, at (-1.0, -1.0) it is 1.02, at (1.0, -1.0) it is 1.57, and at (-1.0, 1.0) it is 0.81.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that the value generally decreases as you move away from the origin, but the rate of decrease varies depending on the direction.

Diagonal movements seem to have intermediate values compared to purely horizontal or vertical movements."
