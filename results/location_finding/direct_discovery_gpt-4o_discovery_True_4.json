Conversely, low intensities suggest the absence of nearby sources.\n\n2. **Relative Positioning**: If you observe high intensity at a point, check nearby points in various directions (e.g., along the x and y axes) to see how the intensity changes.

High intensities at multiple points suggest a source is nearby.\n\n4. **Patterns**: Look for patterns in intensity changes.

Based on these assumptions, I will predict a slightly lower intensity than 2.15, considering potential distance from the source.</thought>\n<answer>1.90</answer>",
