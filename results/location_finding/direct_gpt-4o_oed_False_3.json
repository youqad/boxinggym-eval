The interaction between x and y coordinates can lead to a reduction in the scalar value when both are positive or negative. Given the point [-0.0978349, 1.54056955], the x-coordinate is slightly negative, and the y-coordinate is positive and greater than 1. From previous observations, a positive y-coordinate tends to increase the scalar value, while a slightly negative x-coordinate might slightly decrease it. Considering these factors, I estimate the scalar value to be slightly higher than the value at (0.0, 1.0), which was 25.3, but not as high as the value at (1.0, 0.0), which was 57.48.</thought>\n<answer>26.50</answer>",
