As you move away from (0,0), values generally decrease, but at different rates depending on direction. The function exhibits non-monotonic behavior, particularly along the x-axis where values initially decrease but then begin increasing again at greater distances.\n\nThe decrease is steeper in the positive y-direction compared to the x-direction. In the positive quadrant (x>0, y>0), values continue to decrease as distance from origin increases, with the lowest values occurring furthest from the origin.\n\nThe function lacks perfect symmetry across axes, though there are similarities between corresponding points in different quadrants. The rate of change varies throughout the space - sometimes gradual, sometimes more dramatic.\n\nTo predict values at any point, consider both its distance from the origin and its specific direction (not just distance alone). Points equidistant from the origin can have significantly different values depending on their angular position.\n</answer>"
