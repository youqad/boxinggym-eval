Then, observe points along the axes, like (1.0, 0.0) and (0.0, 1.0), to understand how the value changes in each direction. Continue by checking points in the opposite directions, such as (-1.0, 0.0) and (0.0, -1.0), to see if the changes are symmetrical. Diagonal points like (1.0, 1.0), (-1.0, -1.0), (1.0, -1.0), and (-1.0, 1.0) can help identify any directional trends.
