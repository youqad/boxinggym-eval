The function has a minimum value around x=0 when y is fixed, and increases as |x| increases.

However, there's a complex interaction between x and y, as seen in the unexpectedly low value at [-1,-1].\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nThe function appears to follow a quadratic pattern with respect to both x and y coordinates. It has these key characteristics:\n\n1. The function has a minimum value around x=0 (when y is held constant) and increases as x moves away from zero in either direction.\n\n2. The function generally increases as y decreases, with particularly high values when y is negative.\n\n3. There's a significant interaction between x and y variables that creates a complex surface.\n\n4. The highest values occur when one variable is at an extreme (very positive or very negative) while the other is at a specific value.\n\n5.
