The intensity generally decreases as you move upward, with the top edge having significantly lower values (0.2-0.4).\n\nInterestingly, some areas experience destructive interference, creating negative values, particularly near the middle of the right edge. The center of the grid maintains moderate intensity (around 0.5).\n\nTo predict intensity at any point:\n1. Points closer to bottom corners will have higher values (1.5-2.2)\n2. Points along the top edge will have lower values (0.2-1.0)\n3. Points near the right middle edge may have negative values\n4. The center region has moderate values (0.4-0.6)\n5.

The signal at [1.0, 1.0] is moderately high\n\nI need to explain these patterns in a way that allows someone to make reasonable predictions without knowing the exact source locations or doing complex calculations.\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nThe signal intensity in this environment follows predictable patterns that allow for estimation without knowing source locations. Based on observations, the signal is strongest near the bottom corners of the grid ([0.0, 0.0] and [1.0, 0.0]), with values around 2.0. The intensity generally decreases as you move upward, with the top edge having significantly lower values (0.2-0.4).\n\nInterestingly, some areas experience destructive interference, creating negative values, particularly near the middle of the right edge. The center of the grid maintains moderate intensity (around 0.5).\n\nTo predict intensity at any point:\n1. Points closer to bottom corners will have higher values (1.5-2.2)\n2. Points along the top edge will have lower values (0.2-1.0)\n3. Points near the right middle edge may have negative values\n4. The center region has moderate values (0.4-0.6)\n5. Intensity changes gradually between these regions\n\nThese guidelines allow for reasonable predictions without complex calculations or knowing exact source locations.\n</answer>",
