Look for peaks in the signal intensity, which often indicate the presence of a source nearby. If you find a high-intensity peak, the source is likely very close to that point.\n\n2. **Gradient Analysis**: Analyze the gradient of the signal intensity. As you move away from a source, the intensity typically decreases. By comparing the intensity at different points, you can infer the direction and approximate distance to the source.\n\n3. **Multiple Sources**: Since there are three sources, expect multiple peaks or regions of high intensity. If you observe multiple high-intensity areas, it suggests the presence of multiple sources.\n\n4. **Interpolation**: Use interpolation between known high-intensity points to estimate the intensity at intermediate points. For example, if you know the intensity at [0.79, 0.0] and [0.81, 0.0], you can estimate the intensity at [0.8, 0.0].\n\nBy combining these heuristics, you can make reasonable predictions about the signal intensity at any given point without explicitly knowing the source locations."
