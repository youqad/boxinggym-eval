This suggests that the sources might be clustered near the origin.\n\nFor a signal from a point source, the intensity typically follows an inverse square law, decreasing proportionally to 1/r\u00b2 where r is the distance from the source. However, with three sources, the superposition creates a more complex pattern.\n\nGiven the limited data I have, I'll make a rough estimate based on the trend I've observed. The point [0.70844566, -0.22285333] is:\n- About 0.71 units in the positive x direction (similar to moving toward [1, 0])\n- About 0.22 units in the negative y direction\n\nMoving in the positive x direction decreased the signal from 3.98 to 1.87 (a drop of about 2.11 for a 1-unit move). So moving about 0.71 units might decrease it by approximately 0.71 \u00d7 2.11 \u2248 1.50.\n\nMoving in the positive y direction decreased the signal from 3.98 to 0.77 (a drop of about 3.21 for a 1-unit move). Moving in the negative y direction might have the opposite effect, but without more data, I can't be certain. If I assume some symmetry, moving 0.22 units in the negative y direction might increase the signal by approximately 0.22 \u00d7 3.21 \u2248 0.71.\n\nStarting from 3.98 at the origin:\n- Effect of x movement: -1.50\n- Effect of y movement: +0.71\n- Estimated signal: 3.98 - 1.50 + 0.71 \u2248 3.19\n\nHowever, this linear approximation is very rough. The actual signal pattern is likely more complex due to the superposition of three sources. Given the limited data, I'll estimate the signal at [0.70844566, -0.22",

Since the point is about 82% of the way from [0, 0] to [0, 1] along the y-axis, and the intensity drops by about 3.21 units over that distance, I'd expect a drop of about 0.82 * 3.21 = 2.63 units from the [0, 0] value of 3.98, giving approximately 1.35.\n\nBut this is a rough linear interpolation and doesn't account for the actual physics of signal propagation from three sources.
