The signal intensity follows an inverse square law with distance from each source (signal \u221d 1/d\u00b2)\n2. The total signal at any point is the sum of contributions from all three sources\n3. The sources are located at approximately:\n   - Source 1: (0.330, -0.201)\n   - Source 2: (0.044, -0.125)\n   - Source 3: (0.000, -0.328)\n4. Each source has the same strength (around 2.647)\n5. There's some noise in the measurements (sigma \u2248 3.156)\n\nThis explains why:\n- The origin [0,0] had high signal (33.67) - it's close to all three sources\n- [0.1, 0] had even higher signal (40.23) - it's closer to Source 1\n- Moving in negative y direction initially increased signal (at [0,-1]) because it moved closer to the sources\n- Moving too far in any direction decreased signal due to the inverse square law\n\nI'll create an explanation that helps users predict signal intensity without knowing exact source locations.\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nTo predict signal intensity at any point in the grid, understand that the signal follows an inverse square law pattern from three hidden sources. The intensity decreases rapidly as you move away from each source, and the total signal at any point is the sum of contributions from all three sources.\n\nMy observations revealed that signal intensity is highest near the origin and drops quickly as you move away. The signal pattern suggests the sources are clustered near the origin, slightly biased toward the negative y-axis.\n\nFor practical predictions:\n1. Expect highest intensity (30-40 units) very close to the origin\n2. Signal drops dramatically (to 1-2 units) when moving just 1-2 units away in any direction\n3. The signal decay follows a 1/d\u00b2 pattern, where d is distance from each source\n4. Points slightly in the negative y direction from the origin have moderately high signals (5-10 units)\n\nThis pattern allows you to make reasonable predictions about signal intensity at any point without knowing the exact source locations - just consider the approximate distance from the origin-centered cluster.\n</answer>"

Expect highest intensity (30-40 units) very close to the origin\n2. Signal drops dramatically (to 1-2 units) when moving just 1-2 units away in any direction\n3. The signal decay follows a 1/d\u00b2 pattern, where d is distance from each source\n4.

The signal intensity follows an inverse square law with distance from each source (signal \u221d 1/d\u00b2)\n2. The total signal at any point is the sum of contributions from all three sources\n3. The sources are located at approximately:\n   - Source 1: (0.330, -0.201)\n   - Source 2: (0.044, -0.125)\n   - Source 3: (0.000, -0.328)\n4. Each source has the same strength (around 2.647)\n5. There's some noise in the measurements (sigma \u2248 3.156)\n\nThis explains why:\n- The origin [0,0] had high signal (33.67) - it's close to all three sources\n- [0.1, 0] had even higher signal (40.23) - it's closer to Source 1\n- Moving in negative y direction initially increased signal (at [0,-1]) because it moved closer to the sources\n- Moving too far in any direction decreased signal due to the inverse square law\n\nI'll create an explanation that helps users predict signal intensity without knowing exact source locations.\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nTo predict signal intensity at any point in the grid, understand that the signal follows an inverse square law pattern from three hidden sources.
