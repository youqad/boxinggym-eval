Start by observing at key points like the origin [0, 0], which gives you a baseline intensity. Then, observe points in different quadrants to see how the intensity changes. For instance, observe [1, 0] and [0, 1] to understand the intensity along the axes, and [1, 1] to check for diagonal effects. Observing [-1, 0] and [0, -1] helps determine if the sources are symmetrically placed or if there's a dominant source along the axes. Finally, observe points like [0.5, 0.5] to check for concentration near the origin. By comparing these observations, you can infer the general pattern of the sources' distribution and predict the intensity at any given point based on the observed trends."
