If you observe a peak, it\u2019s likely that a source is close to that point.\n\n2. **Gradient Analysis**: Observe how the intensity changes as you move away from a known high-intensity point. A rapid decrease in intensity suggests you are moving away from a source, while a gradual decrease might indicate multiple sources.\n\n3. **Bisecting Strategy**: Use a bisection method to narrow down the location of sources. For example, if you observe high intensity at [0.0, -0.875] and lower intensity at [0.0, -0.75], bisect the interval to check [0.0, -0.8125].\n\n4. **Grid Search**: Perform a grid search around areas of high intensity to find local maxima.
