            "To predict the signal intensity without knowing the exact source locations, you can use a few heuristic guidelines based on the observed patterns:\n\n1. **Symmetry and Asymmetry**: Observe the symmetry or asymmetry in the signal intensities. If the signal intensity is higher in one direction (e.g., positive y-axis) and lower in the opposite direction (e.g., negative y-axis), it suggests that sources are likely located in the higher-intensity region.\n\n2. **Gradient Analysis**: Look for gradients in signal intensity. Higher gradients (rapid changes in intensity) often indicate proximity to a source. For example, if the intensity increases sharply as you move from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.0, 1.0), it suggests a source is nearby.\n\n3. **Intermediate Points**: Check intermediate points between high and low intensity regions to narrow down the source location. For instance, if the intensity is high at (0.0, 0.5) and lower at (0.0, 1.0), checking (0.0, 0.75) can help pinpoint the source.\n\n4. **Combining Observations**: Use multiple observations to triangulate the source locations. By comparing intensities at different points, you can infer the relative positions of the sources.\n\nBy following these heuristics, you can make educated guesses about the signal intensity at any given point without needing to know the exact source locations."
