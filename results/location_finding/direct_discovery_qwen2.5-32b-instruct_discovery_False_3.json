Then, observe points along the axes, like (1.0, 0.0) and (0.0, 1.0), to understand how the value changes in each direction. Next, check points in the opposite directions, such as (-1.0, 0.0) and (0.0, -1.0), to assess symmetry and consistency. Diagonal points like (1.0, 1.0) and (-1.0, -1.0) can reveal how the function behaves when moving in combined directions. Midpoints like (0.5, 0.5) can help interpolate values between key points. By systematically observing these points, you can build a model that captures the underlying function's behavior and make reliable predictions for any given 2D vector."
