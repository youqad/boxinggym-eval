If you find a point with high intensity, nearby points are likely to have similar or slightly lower intensities. Conversely, low-intensity points suggest that sources are further away.\n\n2. **Directional Exploration**: If you observe a high intensity in a particular direction, it may indicate a source in that direction. Explore points along that direction to see if the intensity increases or decreases, helping you infer the source's proximity.\n\n3. **Central Points**: Start by observing central points like the origin. This can give a balanced view of the intensity from all sources, helping you identify potential directions where sources might be located.\n\n4. **Quadrant Analysis**: Divide the grid into quadrants and observe points in each. This helps identify which quadrants have higher intensities, suggesting the presence of sources.\n\nBy using these guidelines, you can make educated guesses about intensity patterns without needing precise source locations."

However, since it is not exactly at the origin, the intensity might be slightly lower due to the distance from the central point. I will estimate the intensity based on a slight decrease from the central point's intensity.</thought>\n<answer>55.00</answer>",
