If the intensity is higher in one direction (e.g., negative x-axis), it suggests that sources are likely located in that region.\n\n2. **Gradient Analysis**: Look for areas where the signal intensity changes rapidly. These regions often indicate the proximity of sources. For example, if the intensity drops sharply moving away from a point, that point is likely close to a source.\n\n3. **Midpoint Strategy**: Use a binary search-like approach to narrow down the location of high-intensity regions. Start with broad intervals and gradually reduce them to find the peak intensity.\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify patterns in the observed data. For instance, if the intensity peaks at a certain distance from the origin, similar peaks may occur at symmetric points.\n\nBy combining these heuristics, you can make educated guesses about the intensity at unobserved points, even without knowing the exact source locations.
