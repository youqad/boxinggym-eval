Even if you don't know where the sources are, you can assume that multiple sources will collectively influence the intensity at a given location.\n\n3. **Uniform Distribution of Sources**: Assume that sources are distributed within a certain range. This means that any point within this range could potentially be influenced by multiple sources, leading to varying intensity levels.\n\n4. **Noise and Variability**: Real-world measurements include noise, which can slightly alter the observed intensity. Expect some variability in intensity readings due to this noise.\n\n5. **Empirical Observations**: Use initial observations to identify areas of high intensity, which suggest proximity to sources. Gradually explore other areas to understand the intensity gradient and refine predictions.\n\nBy considering these principles, you can make informed predictions about signal intensity at various points, even without precise source locations."
