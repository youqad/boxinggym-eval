If you observe high intensity in one direction, there's likely a source nearby. Conversely, low intensity suggests the absence of sources in that area.\n\n2. **Gradient Analysis**: Observe how the intensity changes as you move away from a point of interest. A rapid decrease in intensity suggests moving away from a source, while a gradual decrease might indicate multiple sources.\n\n3. **Cross-Validation**: Use multiple points to cross-validate your observations. For instance, if you observe high intensity along the x-axis, check points along the y-axis to ensure there are no significant sources there.\n\n4. **Interpolation**: Use the observed intensities to interpolate values between known points.
