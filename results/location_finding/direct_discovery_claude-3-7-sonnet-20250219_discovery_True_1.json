Based on observations, the signal appears strongest in the negative x-axis region and southwest/southeast quadrants, while weakest in the northern regions.\n\nTo predict intensity at any point:\n\n1. Recognize that intensity generally decreases as you move north and increases as you move south.\n2. The negative x-axis shows particularly high intensity, suggesting concentration of sources.\n3. Intensity tends to be higher along the x-axis than the y-axis.\n4. When moving away from high-intensity regions, expect gradual falloff rather than sharp drops.\n\nYou can make reasonable predictions by mentally interpolating between known points. For example, if you know intensities at [0,0] and [1,0], you can estimate the intensity at [0.5,0] to be somewhere between those values.\n\nThis approach allows for approximate predictions without knowing exact source locations or performing complex calculations.\n</answer>"

This suggests the intensity might be higher than 1.66.\n\nGiven all this information, I estimate the intensity at [0.60190972, -0.87847199] to be around 2.5 to 3.5.
