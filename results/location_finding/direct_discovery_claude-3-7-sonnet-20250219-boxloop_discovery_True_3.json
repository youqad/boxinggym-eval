Based on my analysis, I can offer these guidelines for predicting signal intensity:\n\n1. Signal strength follows an inverse square law - intensity decreases rapidly as you move away from sources.\n\n2. The highest signal intensities are found in the left quadrant of the grid (negative x-axis), particularly around coordinates (-1, 0) to (-1.5, 0.5).\n\n3. Signal intensity generally increases as you move upward (positive y direction) from the origin.\n\n4. Signal intensity decreases as you move right (positive x direction) from the origin.\n\n5. The total intensity at any point is simply the sum of contributions from all three sources.\n\nYou don't need to know the exact source locations to make reasonable predictions. Instead, use these regional patterns - expect very high readings in the left quadrant, moderate readings in the upper-left quadrant, and lower readings in the right half of the grid.\n\nFor quick estimates, compare your target point's position relative to these high and low signal regions.\n</answer>",

Let me reconsider the model. The signal might not be exactly inverse square, or there might be a multiplier involved. \n\nGiven that we're quite far from all three sources (the point is in the negative y direction, while all sources have positive or near-zero y-coordinates), a low signal is expected. But I should double-check my calculation.\n\nActually, I think the issue might be that I'm not accounting for a baseline signal or a multiplier in the model. The inverse square law gives very small values at large distances.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The point [-1.79, -3.22] is in the negative y direction and somewhat in the negative x direction. It's quite far from all three sources, which are clustered in the upper-left quadrant. Based on the patterns I observed, I would expect a relatively low signal here.\n\nGiven the limited information, I'll estimate the signal to be around 0.02.\n</thought>\n\n<answer>0.02</answer>",

Since signal follows an inverse square law, I expect the intensity to be relatively low at this point.\n\nLet me calculate the approximate distances from each source to this point:\n\nFrom source 1 at (-1.64, 0.39):\nDistance = sqrt((1.8341511 - (-1.64))\u00b2 + (0.23298886 - 0.39)\u00b2)\n        = sqrt((3.4741511)\u00b2 + (-0.15701114)\u00b2)\n        = sqrt(12.07 + 0.025)\n        = sqrt(12.095)\n        \u2248 3.48\n\nFrom source 2 at (-0.53, 0.67):\nDistance = sqrt((1.8341511 - (-0.53))\u00b2 + (0.23298886 - 0.67)\u00b2)\n        = sqrt((2.3641511)\u00b2 + (-0.43701114)\u00b2)\n        = sqrt(5.59 + 0.19)\n        = sqrt(5.78)\n        \u2248 2.40\n\nFrom source 3 at (-1.39, 0.06):\nDistance = sqrt((1.8341511 - (-1.39))\u00b2 + (0.23298886 - 0.06)\u00b2)\n        = sqrt((3.2241511)\u00b2 + (0.17298886)\u00b2)\n        = sqrt(10.40 + 0.03)\n        = sqrt(10.43)\n        \u2248 3.23\n\nUsing the inverse square law, the intensity contribution from each source would be proportional to 1/d\u00b2, where d is the distance:\n\nFrom source 1: k\u2081/(3.48)\u00b2 = k\u2081/12.11 \u2248 0.083k\u2081\nFrom source 2: k\u2082/(2.40)\u00b2 = k\u2082/5.76 \u2248 0.174k\u2082\nFrom source 3: k\u2083/(3.23)\u00b2 = k\u2083/10.43 \u2248 0.096k\u2083\n\nWhere k\u2081, k\u2082, k\u2083 are constants representing the strength of each source.\n\nSince the point is far from all sources and in the positive x region (which I noted has lower signal), I expect the intensity to be quite low, probably between 0.2 and 0.5.\n\nGiven that we don't know the exact values of k\u2081, k\u2082, k\u2083, I'll make my best estimate based on the patterns observed. The point is in a region where we expect low signal, so I'll estimate the intensity to be around 0.35.\n</thought>\n\n<answer>0.35</answer>"
