Next, observe points along the axes, such as (1.0, 0.0) and (0.0, 1.0), to understand the behavior along each axis independently. Then, observe points in different quadrants, like (-1.0, -1.0), (-1.0, 1.0), and (1.0, -1.0), to detect any symmetries or asymmetries. Additionally, observe points with larger magnitudes, such as (2.0, 0.0), to assess the rate of change and potential non-linearities. By collecting these observations, you can infer the underlying function's characteristics, such as linearity, symmetry, and interactions between coordinates.
