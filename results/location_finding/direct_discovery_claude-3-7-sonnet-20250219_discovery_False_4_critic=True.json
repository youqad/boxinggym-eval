The most notable characteristic is that values increase dramatically in regions with negative x-coordinates, particularly when combined with positive y-coordinates. This creates an area of extremely high values in the upper-left quadrant of the coordinate system.\n\nAs you move toward positive x-coordinates, the function values decrease significantly. The effect of the y-coordinate is more nuanced - at x=0, the function appears to have a local maximum, with values decreasing as y moves away from zero in either direction.\n\nHowever, when x is negative, increasing y leads to much larger function values, suggesting a strong interaction effect between these dimensions.\n\nThe function appears to grow exponentially or quadratically as you move further into the negative x region. Meanwhile, in the positive x region (especially when both x and y are positive), the function maintains relatively low, stable values.\n\nFor accurate predictions, pay special attention to the sign of the coordinates, as the function behaves very differently in each quadrant of the coordinate plane.\n</answer>"

The most notable characteristic is that values increase dramatically in regions with negative x-coordinates, particularly when combined with positive y-coordinates. This creates an area of extremely high values in the upper-left quadrant of the coordinate system.\n\nAs you move toward positive x-coordinates, the function values decrease significantly. The effect of the y-coordinate is more nuanced - at x=0, the function appears to have a local maximum, with values decreasing as y moves away from zero in either direction.\n\nHowever, when x is negative, increasing y leads to much larger function values, suggesting a strong interaction effect between these dimensions.\n\nThe function appears to grow exponentially or quadratically as you move further into the negative x region. Meanwhile, in the positive x region (especially when both x and y are positive), the function maintains relatively low, stable values.\n\nFor accurate predictions, pay special attention to the sign of the coordinates, as the function behaves very differently in each quadrant of the coordinate plane.\n</answer>",
