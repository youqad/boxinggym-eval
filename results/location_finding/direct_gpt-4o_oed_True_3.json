        "role:assistant, messaage:<thought>Based on the observations, the intensity seems to be influenced by the proximity to sources, with higher intensities near sources and lower intensities further away. The point [0.81922975, 1.99645882] is relatively close to the origin and the positive x-axis, where we observed varying intensities.
