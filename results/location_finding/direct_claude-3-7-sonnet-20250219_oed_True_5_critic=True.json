Moving to [0, 1] drops the intensity to 2.7, but not as much as [1, 0]\n\nThis suggests that at least one source might be close to the origin, and the sources are more concentrated toward the negative x-axis than the positive x-axis.\n\nThe point [-0.48433558, 0.41718482] is in the negative x direction and positive y direction from the origin. Since the intensity decreased less when moving in the positive y direction than in the positive x direction, and the target point is in the negative x direction (where we haven't measured but might expect higher intensity based on our observations), I would expect the intensity to be higher than at [0, 1] but possibly not as high as at [0, 0].\n\nGiven the limited data, I'll estimate the intensity at [-0.48433558, 0.41718482] to be around 5.20, which is between the values at [0, 0] and [0, 1], but closer to [0, 0] since we're moving in what appears to be a favorable direction (negative x).\n</thought>\n<answer>5.20</answer>",
