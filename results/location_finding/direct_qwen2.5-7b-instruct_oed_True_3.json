To further understand the positions of the sources, we should observe a point that is equidistant from the origin and lies on a diagonal line, such as [1, -1]. This will help us determine if the sources are positioned symmetrically or asymmetrically around the line y = -x.</thought>\n<observe>[1, -1]</observe>",
