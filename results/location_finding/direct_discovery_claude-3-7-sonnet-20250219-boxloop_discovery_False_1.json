Moving in positive x1 direction slightly decreases the output (small negative coefficient)\n2. Moving in positive x2 direction significantly decreases the output (larger negative coefficient)\n3. The baseline value (at origin) is around 3 (the intercept)\n4. There's considerable noise in the observations (sigma is large)\n\nI need to explain this in simple terms without directly referencing the model or my specific observations.\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nThe environment contains a 2D grid where each point maps to a numerical value. After extensive exploration, I've discovered that this mapping follows a pattern where:\n\n1. The value decreases slightly as you move east (positive x-direction)\n2. The value decreases more significantly as you move north (positive y-direction)\n3. Consequently, the value increases as you move south (negative y-direction)\n4. The baseline value near the origin is approximately 3\n\nThis pattern suggests an underlying linear relationship between the coordinates and the output value. However, there's considerable variability in the observations, indicating the presence of random noise that makes precise predictions challenging.\n\nTo predict values at any point, estimate the baseline value (around 3), then subtract small amounts for eastward movement, larger amounts for northward movement, and add corresponding amounts for westward and southward movements. Remember that predictions won't be exact due to the inherent randomness in the system.\n</answer>"
