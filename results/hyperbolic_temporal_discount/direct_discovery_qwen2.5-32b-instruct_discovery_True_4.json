            "To predict a person's choice between a delayed reward and an immediate reward, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Immediate Reward vs. Delayed Reward Magnitude**: People tend to prefer a larger reward, but the gap between the immediate and delayed rewards matters. For instance, if the immediate reward is close to the delayed reward, people might opt for the immediate reward due to its certainty and immediacy.\n\n2. **Delay Duration**: The length of the delay significantly influences the decision. Shorter delays often favor the delayed reward, especially if the delayed reward is substantially larger. Longer delays typically lead to a preference for the immediate reward due to the uncertainty and impatience.\n\n3. **Threshold Effect**: There seems to be a threshold where the immediate reward becomes more attractive. In our observations, this threshold appears to be around 8 dollars for a delayed reward of 10 dollars. Below this threshold (e.g., 7 dollars), the delayed reward is preferred, and above it (e.g., 9 dollars), the immediate reward is chosen.\n\n4. **Consistency Across Delays**: Shorter delays (e.g., 7 days) favor the delayed reward, while longer delays (e.g., 30 days) favor the immediate reward. Intermediate delays (e.g., 20 days) can vary but generally lean towards the immediate reward if the immediate reward is close to the threshold.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can predict a person's choice based on the relative sizes of the rewards and the length of the delay."
