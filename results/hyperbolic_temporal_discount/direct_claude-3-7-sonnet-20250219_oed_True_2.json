However, when the amounts were larger (100 dollars), they weren't willing to wait even a month for a 5% increase.\n\nThis suggests that for larger amounts, they require a higher return rate to be willing to wait. The question involves a fairly large amount (214 dollars) and a long wait (306 days), but the return is substantial (30%).\n\nGiven that they were willing to wait 365 days for a 10% increase on a small amount, I think they would be willing to wait 306 days for a 30% increase on a larger amount.
