All other cases resulted in 1.\n\nLooking at the parameters I need to predict: [13, 253, 171]\n\nThe third parameter (171) is quite large, similar to the cases where I observed 0. However, I need to determine if there's a specific relationship between the three numbers that determines the outcome.\n\nOne possibility is that the result is 0 when the third parameter is larger than some function of the first two parameters. Let me check if there's a pattern:\n\nFor [5, 10, 100] \u2192 0: 100 is 10 times the second parameter (10)\nFor [20, 30, 100] \u2192 0: 100 is about 3.33 times the second parameter (30)\n\nFor [13, 253, 171], 171 is about 0.68 times the second parameter (253).\n\nAnother possibility is that it depends on whether the third parameter is greater than the difference between the first two parameters:\nFor [5, 10, 100] \u2192 0: 100 > (10-5) = 5\nFor [20, 30, 100] \u2192 0: 100 > (30-20) = 10\n\nFor [13, 253, 171], 171 > (253-13) = 240? No, that's not right. 253-13 = 240, and 171 < 240.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe it's about whether the third parameter can be expresse",
