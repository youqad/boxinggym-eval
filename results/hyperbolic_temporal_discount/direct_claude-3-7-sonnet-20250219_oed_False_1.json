However, I've only tested with the first two parameters being [1, 2]. \n\nLet me think about what might be happening. One possibility is that the result is 0 when the third parameter is divisible by 2 (i.e., even), and 1 otherwise. But that doesn't match my observations since [1, 2, 4] gave a result of 1.\n\nAnother possibility is that the result depends on the relationship between all three parameters. For example, maybe the result is 0 when the third parameter equals the difference between the first two parameters (2 - 1 = 1), and 1 otherwise. But that doesn't match either since [1, 2, 1] gave a result of 1.\n\nGiven the limited data, my best guess is that the result is 0 when the third parameter is 2, and 1 otherwise. For [299, 300, 96], the third parameter is 96, which is not 2, so I would predict a result of 1.\n\nHowever, I'm not very confident in this prediction because I haven't explored enough of the parameter space to understand the true pattern. I've only varied the third parameter while keeping the first two constant.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Another possibility is that the result depends on whether the third parameter is divisible by some function of the first two parameters. For example, if the third parameter is divisible by the difference between the second and first parameters (which is 1 in my observations), then the result might be 0. In the case of [1, 2, 2], 2 is divisible by (2-1)=1, so the result is 0. For [299, 300, 96], the difference is (300-299)=1, and 96 is divisible by 1, so the result might be 0.\n\nBut wait, all numbers are divisible by 1, so that doesn't explain why [1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], and [1, 2, 5] all gave a result of 1.\n\nLet me try another hypothesis. Maybe the result is 0 when the third parameter is divisible by the second parameter, and 1 otherwise. For [1, 2, 2], 2 is divisible by 2, so the result is 0. For [1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3], and [1, 2, 5], the third parameter is not divisible by 2, so the result is 1. For [1, 2, 4], 4 is divisible by 2, but the result was 1, so this hypothesis doesn't hold either.\n\nGiven the limited data and the complexity of the possible patterns, I'll go with my initial observation: the result is 0 when the third parameter is 2, and 1 otherwise.
