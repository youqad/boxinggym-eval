The third parameter is an independent integer.\n\n2. **Consistent Response**: In the experiments conducted, varying each parameter individually or in combination did not change the binary response, which consistently returned a value of 1. This suggests that within the tested range, the response is invariant to changes in the parameters.\n\n3. **Potential Thresholds**: Although the response was consistent, it is possible that thresholds or specific combinations of parameters outside the tested range could influence the response. However, based on the current data, no such thresholds were identified.\n\n4. **Hypothesis**: The environment may be designed to return a consistent response for a wide range of parameter values, or the specific conditions that change the response were not reached in the experiments.\n\nIn summary, based on the observations, the environment's response appears to be consistently 1 for the tested parameter values.
