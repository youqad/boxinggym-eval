            "To predict a person's choice between a delayed reward and an immediate reward, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Reward Difference**: The larger the difference between the immediate reward (iR) and the delayed reward (dR), the more likely the person is to choose the delayed reward. For example, a difference of 4 dollars (e.g., iR = 10, dR = 14) is often sufficient for a short delay.\n\n2. **Delay Duration**: The length of the delay (D) significantly affects the decision. Short delays (e.g., 7 days) are more likely to result in choosing the delayed reward compared to longer delays (e.g., 15 days).\n\n3. **Thresholds**: There seems to be a threshold where a small difference in rewards (e.g., 2 dollars) is not enough to justify waiting, even for a short delay. A moderate difference (e.g., 4 dollars) is often sufficient for a short delay, but a larger difference may be needed for longer delays.\n\nBased on these observations, you can predict that a person is more likely to choose the delayed reward if the difference between dR and iR is substantial and the delay is relatively short. Conversely, if the difference is small or the delay is long, the person is more likely to choose the immediate reward."
