For a 1-week delay, they'll accept a 1.4x reward ratio\n2. For a 2-week delay, they need more than 1.4x but will accept 2x\n3. For a 1-month delay, they need more than 1.4x but will accept 1.5x\n4. For a 3-month delay, they'll still accept a 2x reward ratio\n\nNow for the question: iR = 32, dR = 219, D = 208 (about 7 months)\nThe reward ratio is 219/32 = 6.84x\n\nThis is a much longer delay (208 days) than any I've tested, but the reward ratio (6.84x)",
