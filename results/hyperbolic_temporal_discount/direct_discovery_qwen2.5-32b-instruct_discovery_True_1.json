            "To predict a person's choice between a delayed reward and an immediate reward, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Immediate Reward vs. Delayed Reward Magnitude**: People tend to prefer larger rewards, but the difference in value matters. For instance, a person might choose a delayed reward of $10 over an immediate reward of $6, but might prefer $8 immediately over $10 after a delay.\n\n2. **Delay Duration**: The length of the delay impacts the decision. A shorter delay (e.g., 7 days) might make a larger delayed reward more appealing, whereas a longer delay (e.g., 30 days) might shift preference towards the immediate reward.\n\n3. **Threshold Effect**: There seems to be a threshold where the immediate reward becomes more attractive. In previous observations, the threshold appears to be around $7-$8 for a delay of 7-14 days.\n\n4. **Consistency in Preferences**: If the immediate reward is significantly lower (e.g., $6), people tend to prefer the delayed reward, even with a moderate delay (e.g., 14 days).\n\nBased on these observations, you can predict that:\n- For delays up to 14 days, a person is likely to choose the delayed reward if the immediate reward is $6 or less.\n- For delays up to 7 days, a person might choose the immediate reward if it is $7 or more.\n- Longer delays (e.g., 30 days) generally reduce the attractiveness of the delayed reward, shifting preference towards immediate rewards.\n\nUse these guidelines to make informed predictions about a person's choice between immediate and delayed rewards."
