They rejected the delayed reward (12, 13, 14 vs 10) with a 30-day delay\n4. They rejected the delayed reward (15 vs 10) with 45-day and 60-day delays\n\nThis suggests there's both a reward ratio threshold and a time threshold that affects decisions. The person seems to require at least a 50% increase in reward to wait 30 days, but won't wait 45+ days even for that increase.\n</thought>\n\n<answer>\nThis person's decision-making follows a temporal discounting pattern where both the reward ratio and delay length matter. Based on observations:\n\n1. For a 100% reward increase (e.g., 20 vs 10), they'll wait even for long periods (90+ days)\n2. For a 50% reward increase (e.g., 15 vs 10), they'll wait up to 30 days but not 45+ days\n3. For smaller increases (20-40%), they won't wait even 30 days\n\nTo predict choices:\n- If delayed reward is double or more of immediate reward, predict they'll wait regardless of reasonable delay\n- If delayed reward is 50% more, predict they'll wait only if delay is under ~40 days\n- If delayed reward is less than 50% more, predict they'll take the immediate reward\n\nThis suggests a hyperbolic discounting model where the subjective value of rewards decreases non-linearly with delay, with a relatively low discount rate for large reward differences.\n</answer>"

This is far greater than the 100% increase threshold I identified earlier.\n\nBased on my previous observations, the person chose the delayed reward when it was double (100% increase) the immediate reward, even with delays up to 90 days. While 271 days is longer than any delay I observed before, the reward ratio is extremely high (23.75x).\n\nGiven that the person was willing to wait 90 days for just a 100% increase, it seems very likely they would wait 271 days for a 2375% increase. The magnitude of the reward difference is so large that it likely outweighs the temporal discounting effect.\n\nTherefore, I predict the person will choose the delayed reward (1).\n</thought>\n\n<answer>1</answer>",
