The degree of discounting typically depends on:\n1. The size of the difference between rewards\n2. The length of the delay\n3. Individual differences in patience/impulsivity\n\nIn this case:\n- The delayed reward is only $3 more than the immediate reward (about 10% more)\n- The delay is quite long (108 days, over 3 months)\n- The ratio of reward difference to delay is small ($3/108 days \u2248 $0.028 per day)\n\nGiven these factors, most people would likely choose the immediate reward.

The delayed reward would need to be very large compared to the immediate reward to overcome the temporal discounting.\n\nGiven the parameters, I believe most people would choose the immediate reward of $22 today rather than waiting 57 days for $199, though this is a close call and individual differences in delay discounting would play a major role.\n</thought>\n\n<answer>0</answer>",

The subjective value of a delayed reward can be modeled as:\n\nSubjective Value = Actual Value / (1 + k \u00d7 Delay)\n\nwhere k is a discounting parameter that varies by individual.\n\nThe person will choose the delayed reward if its subjective value exceeds the immediate reward.\n\nLet's consider some factors:\n1.

One common model is hyperbolic discounting, where the subjective value of a delayed reward decreases as the delay increases, but at a decreasing rate.\n\nIn the first observation, the person was willing to wait 7 days to get twice the reward. If they discount linearly, they might be willing to wait 57 days to get about 16.3 times the reward (57/7 \u00d7 2). Since 9.05 is less than 16.3, they might not choose the delayed reward.\n\nHowever, with hyperbolic discounting, the discount factor decreases less than linearly with time.
