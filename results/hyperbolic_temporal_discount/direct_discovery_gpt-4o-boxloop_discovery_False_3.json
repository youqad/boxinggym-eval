            "The environment's binary response is influenced by three parameters: x1, x2, and x3. These parameters interact in a way that can be understood through a logistic regression model, which predicts the probability of a response being 1 or 0. The model uses coefficients (beta_x1, beta_x2, beta_x3) to weigh the influence of each parameter, along with an intercept term.\n\nFrom the inferred parameters, we see that x1 and x2 have larger coefficients (5.098 and 7.752, respectively) compared to x3 (2.716). This suggests that x1 and x2 have a stronger impact on the response than x3. The intercept (0.658) provides a baseline probability when all parameters are zero.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that changes in x1 and x2 are more likely to affect the response than changes in x3. If x1 and x2 are high, the probability of the response being 1 increases significantly. Conversely, x3 has a smaller effect, so changes in this parameter alone may not be sufficient to alter the response.\n\nTo predict the binary response, consider the combined effect of all three parameters, with particular attention to the values of x1 and x2, as they are the most influential."
