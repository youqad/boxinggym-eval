            "To predict a person's choice between a delayed reward and an immediate reward, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Magnitude of Rewards**: People generally prefer larger rewards, but the difference between the immediate and delayed rewards plays a crucial role. A significant gap often favors the delayed reward.\n\n2. **Delay Duration**: The length of the delay impacts the decision. Short delays are easier to tolerate compared to long delays. For instance, a 7-day delay might be more acceptable than a 30-day delay.\n\n3. **Threshold Effect**: There seems to be a specific threshold where the immediate reward becomes more attractive. In our observations, the threshold appears to be around 5.85 to 6 dollars when the delayed reward is 10 dollars and the delay is 14 days.\n\n4. **Consistency**: If the person consistently chooses the delayed reward for smaller immediate rewards and switches to the immediate reward for slightly higher immediate rewards, you can infer the threshold.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can predict that for immediate rewards below the threshold (around 5.85 to 6 dollars), the person is likely to choose the delayed reward. For immediate rewards above this threshold, the person is more likely to choose the immediate reward. Adjustments can be made based on the specific values of the rewards and the delay duration."
