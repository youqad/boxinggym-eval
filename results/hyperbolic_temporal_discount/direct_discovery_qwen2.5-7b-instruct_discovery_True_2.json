Based on the results, the threshold seems to be around $2.9 to $3.0. When the immediate reward is significantly lower than the delayed reward, the person chooses the delayed reward. However, when the immediate reward is very close to the delayed reward, the person may choose the immediate reward.\n\nTo summarize, if the immediate reward \\(iR\\) is significantly lower than the delayed reward \\(dR\\), the person will choose the delayed reward. If \\(iR\\) is very close to \\(dR\\), the person may choose the immediate reward, especially if \\(iR\\) is just below \\(dR\\). For practical purposes, you can assume that the person will choose the delayed reward unless the immediate reward is within a small margin (e.g., $2.9 to $3.0) of the delayed reward.\n\nBased on this understanding, if the immediate reward is significantly lower than the delayed reward, the person will choose the delayed reward.
