The decision-making process can be influenced by several factors: the immediate reward (iR), the delayed reward (dR), and the delay in days (D).\n\nThe model uses a logistic regression approach to estimate the probability of choosing the delayed reward. It incorporates parameters that adjust the influence of each factor. The parameter \\( \\beta_0 \\) represents a baseline preference, while \\( \\beta_1 \\) and \\( \\beta_2 \\) adjust the influence of the immediate reward and the discounted value of the delayed reward, respectively. The discounting factor \\( k \\) reflects how much the value of the delayed reward decreases with time.\n\nIn this context, a higher \\( \\beta_2 \\) suggests a strong preference for the delayed reward when its discounted value is high. Conversely, a negative \\( \\beta_1 \\) indicates a reduced preference for the immediate reward. The threshold for switching preferences is influenced by these parameters, with the person likely choosing the delayed reward if its discounted value outweighs the immediate reward, adjusted by these factors."
