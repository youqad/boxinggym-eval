When the immediate reward is less than this threshold, the person prefers the delayed reward, and when it is greater, they prefer the immediate reward. Based on this, we can predict that if the immediate reward \\(iR\\) is less than approximately $2.975, the person will choose the delayed reward \\(dR\\). Conversely, if \\(iR\\) is greater than or equal to $2.975, the person will choose the immediate reward.\n\nTo summarize, the person's choice can be predicted using the following rule:\n- If \\(iR < 2.975\\), the person will choose the delayed reward (\\(D = 1\\)).\n- If \\(iR \\geq 2.975\\), the person will choose the immediate reward (\\(D = 0\\)).\n\nThis threshold provides a good approximation for predicting the person's choice between a delayed and an immediate reward."
