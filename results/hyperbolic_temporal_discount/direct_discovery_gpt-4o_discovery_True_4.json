            "In this decision-making scenario, a person chooses between an immediate reward and a larger delayed reward. The key factor influencing their choice is the delay period. Initially, the person consistently chose the delayed reward with shorter delays, indicating a preference for larger rewards despite waiting. However, as the delay increased, their preference shifted to the immediate reward, revealing a threshold for waiting.\n\nThe threshold is the maximum delay they are willing to accept for a larger reward. In this case, the person switched to preferring the immediate reward when the delay was between 60 and 75 days. This suggests that their patience or willingness to wait is limited to around 60 days. Beyond this point, the immediate reward becomes more attractive, likely due to the diminishing perceived value of the delayed reward over time.\n\nThis behavior aligns with the concept of temporal discounting, where the perceived value of a reward decreases as the delay to its receipt increases. Understanding this threshold can help predict choices in similar scenarios, where the trade-off between reward size and delay is a critical factor in decision-making."
