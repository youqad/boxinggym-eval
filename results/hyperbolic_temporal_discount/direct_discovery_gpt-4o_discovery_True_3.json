            "In decision-making between an immediate reward and a delayed reward, individuals often weigh the value of the reward against the time they must wait to receive it. This is known as time preference or discounting behavior. Generally, people tend to prefer immediate rewards over delayed ones, even if the delayed reward is larger. However, the extent of this preference varies among individuals.\n\nIn our observations, the person consistently chose a delayed reward of $10 over an immediate reward of $5, even with delays up to 48 days. This indicates a strong preference for larger rewards, showing a low time preference. However, when the delay reached 50 days, they switched to preferring the immediate reward, suggesting their threshold for waiting is around this point.\n\nTo predict a person's choice, consider the size of the rewards and the delay. If the delay is short, they are more likely to choose the delayed reward. As the delay increases, there is a point where the immediate reward becomes more attractive. This threshold varies, but in this case, it was around 50 days. Understanding this balance can help predict choices in similar scenarios."
