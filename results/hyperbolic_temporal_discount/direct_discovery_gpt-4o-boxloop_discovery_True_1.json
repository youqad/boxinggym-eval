            "To predict a person's choice between an immediate and a delayed reward, consider three factors: the difference in reward amounts, the delay duration, and inherent decision-making tendencies. The model suggests that people weigh the larger delayed reward against the immediate one, with a strong preference for the larger reward when the difference is significant. However, as the delay increases, the likelihood of choosing the immediate reward also increases. \n\nThe parameters inferred from the model indicate that the difference in reward amounts (beta_1 = 4.735) has a strong positive influence on choosing the delayed reward. Conversely, the delay duration (beta_2 = -0.501) negatively impacts the choice, meaning longer delays make the immediate reward more attractive. The baseline tendency (beta_0 = 0.287) suggests a slight inherent preference for the delayed reward when other factors are neutral.\n\nIn practical terms, if the delayed reward is significantly larger and the delay is short, the person is likely to choose the delayed reward. As the delay increases, the immediate reward becomes more appealing, especially if the difference in reward amounts is not substantial. Understanding these dynamics can help predict choices in various scenarios."
