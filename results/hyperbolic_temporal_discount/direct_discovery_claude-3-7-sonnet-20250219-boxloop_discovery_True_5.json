The immediate reward amount (higher immediate rewards make waiting less attractive)\n2. The delayed reward amount (higher delayed rewards make waiting more attractive)\n3. The length of the delay (longer waits require larger reward ratios)\n\nWe found that for moderate delays (1-3 months), people typically require at least 2.5 times the immediate amount to choose waiting. For longer delays (around a year), they need significantly more - approximately 7 times the immediate amount.\n\nThe decision follows a pattern where the probability of choosing the delayed reward can be predicted using these three variables. As the immediate reward increases, people are less likely to wait. As the delayed reward increases, people are more likely to wait. The delay duration has a complex effect that interacts with the reward ratio.\n\nTo predict a choice, compare the ratio of delayed/immediate rewards against the required threshold for that specific delay period.\n</answer>"
