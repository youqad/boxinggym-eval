            "In decision-making between a delayed and an immediate reward, individuals often weigh the value of the reward against the time they must wait to receive it. This process is known as temporal discounting. Generally, people tend to prefer immediate rewards over delayed ones, even if the delayed reward is larger, due to the uncertainty and the psychological impact of waiting.\n\nHowever, the preference can shift based on the size of the immediate reward relative to the delayed reward and the length of the delay. If the immediate reward is significantly smaller than the delayed reward, individuals may choose to wait, especially if the delay is short. As the delay increases, the immediate reward becomes more attractive unless it is increased to a point where it outweighs the perceived value of waiting for the larger reward.\n\nIn our observations, the person consistently chose the delayed reward when the immediate reward was 5, regardless of the delay length. However, when the immediate reward was increased to 6 or more, they switched to preferring the immediate reward, even with a long delay. This suggests a threshold where the immediate reward becomes more appealing, influenced by both the reward size and the delay duration."
