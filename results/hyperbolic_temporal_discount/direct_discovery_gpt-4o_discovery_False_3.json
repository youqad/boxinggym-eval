Initially, when the first parameter was less than 20, the response was consistently 1, regardless of changes in the second and third parameters. However, when the first parameter was increased to 20, the response changed to 0, indicating a threshold effect.\n\nThe second and third parameters, within the ranges tested, did not independently affect the response. This suggests that the first parameter is the key determinant of the binary response, with a threshold around 20. When the first parameter is below 20, the response is 1, and when it is 20 or above, the response changes to 0.\n\nTo predict the binary response, focus on the first parameter: if it is less than 20, expect a response of 1; if it is 20 or more, expect a response of 0.
