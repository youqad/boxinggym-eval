The key factors influencing their choice are the size of the immediate reward, the size of the delayed reward, and the length of the delay.\n\nFrom our observations, the person consistently chose the delayed reward when the immediate reward was 5, even with delays up to 60 days. However, when the immediate reward increased to 6 or more, they switched to preferring the immediate reward, indicating a threshold between 5 and 6 for a 60-day delay.\n\nThis suggests the person has a relatively low time preference, valuing future rewards significantly unless the immediate reward becomes sufficiently large. The longer the delay, the more attractive the immediate reward needs to be to change their preference.\n\nIn general, people with low time preference are more likely to wait for larger rewards, while those with high time preference prefer immediate gratification. The exact threshold varies based on individual preferences and the specific values of the rewards and delay. Understanding these dynamics can help predict choices in similar scenarios."
