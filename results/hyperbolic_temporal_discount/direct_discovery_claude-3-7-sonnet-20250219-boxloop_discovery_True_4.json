When deciding between $10 now or $20 later, we found people will wait up to 4 months, but not 5 months or longer. When the delayed reward increases to $30 (3x the immediate amount), people's patience extends to at least 6 months but not a full year.\n\nThese choices reflect how people discount future rewards based on three key factors:\n\n1. The size of the immediate reward (larger immediate rewards are more tempting)\n2. The size of the delayed reward (larger delayed rewards increase patience)\n3. The length of the delay (longer waits reduce willingness to delay)\n\nThe relationship follows a logistic pattern where the probability of choosing the delayed option depends on the balance of these factors. The immediate reward has the strongest influence (negative effect), followed by the delayed reward amount (positive effect), with the delay period having the smallest impact.\n\nTo predict someone's choice, consider the ratio between rewards and the delay length - higher reward ratios can compensate for longer delays.\n</answer>"

When the delayed reward increases to $30 (3x the immediate amount), people's patience extends to at least 6 months but not a full year.\n\nThese choices reflect how people discount future rewards based on three key factors:\n\n1. The size of the immediate reward (larger immediate rewards are more tempting)\n2. The size of the delayed reward (larger delayed rewards increase patience)\n3. The length of the delay (longer waits reduce willingness to delay)\n\nThe relationship follows a logistic pattern where the probability of choosing the delayed option depends on the balance of these factors. The immediate reward has the strongest influence (negative effect), followed by the delayed reward amount (positive effect), with the delay period having the smallest impact.\n\nTo predict someone's choice, consider the ratio between rewards and the delay length - higher reward ratios can compensate for longer delays.\n</answer>",
