            "In decision-making between an immediate and a delayed reward, individuals often weigh the value of the reward against the time they must wait to receive it. This process is known as temporal discounting. Generally, people tend to prefer immediate rewards over delayed ones, even if the delayed reward is larger, due to the uncertainty and the psychological cost of waiting.\n\nHowever, the degree to which a person discounts future rewards can vary. Some individuals are more patient and willing to wait for a larger reward, while others prefer the certainty of an immediate, smaller reward. The threshold at which a person switches from preferring a delayed reward to an immediate one can depend on several factors, including the size of the reward difference, the length of the delay, and personal traits such as impulsivity and patience.\n\nIn the context of the experiments, the person consistently chose the delayed reward up to a certain point, indicating a high tolerance for waiting when the reward difference was significant. However, as the delay increased beyond a certain threshold, the immediate reward became more attractive. This threshold can be seen as the point where the psychological cost of waiting outweighs the benefit of the larger reward."
