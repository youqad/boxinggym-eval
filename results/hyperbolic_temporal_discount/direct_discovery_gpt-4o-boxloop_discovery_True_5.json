            "To predict a person's choice between an immediate and a delayed reward, consider three factors: the size of the immediate reward (iR), the size of the delayed reward (dR), and the delay in days (D). The decision-making process can be thought of as weighing these factors to determine the perceived value of each option.\n\nThe inferred parameters suggest that the person places significant weight on the size of the delayed reward (beta_dr = 1.040), meaning they are likely to choose the delayed reward if it is substantially larger. The immediate reward has a negative influence (beta_ir = -0.812), indicating that as the immediate reward increases, the likelihood of choosing it increases, but not as strongly as the influence of the delayed reward. The delay in days has a small negative impact (beta_days = -0.114), suggesting that longer delays slightly decrease the attractiveness of the delayed reward.\n\nThe intercept (0.132) provides a baseline preference for the delayed reward. Overall, the person is more likely to choose the delayed reward unless the immediate reward is very close in value or the delay is excessively long. Understanding these influences can help predict choices in different scenarios."
